# Sourcing Guidelines

Links must be archived using archive.today (or any of its TLD variants).
The organizations on the distrustful list below cannot be used as sources.

## Distrustful

Instead of selectively picking which news outlets to trust, we give every single one the benefit of the doubt.
If a news outlet does something to betray trust, we will mark it as distrustful (meaning it can no longer be used by BigTech.fail as a source, unless it is the primary source of a story that has been verified by others).
Each entry on the distrustful list will contain which offenses (what story, event, etc.) got them there (exception: Buzzfeed).

Being marked as distrustful is **not permanent**.
As an appendix to each offense, there will be a way to "reconcile" that offense.
A news outlet will no longer be marked distrustful once all offenses are reconciled (exception: Buzzfeed).

### Business Insider

* 19 May 2020 - **Promotion and Monetization of Censorship** -
Martin Coulter, a tech reporter for Business Insider, reached out to Dave Cullen of [Computing Forever](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/computingforever/) for comment regarding the removal of [one of his recent videos](https://www.bitchute.com/video/Avc6_ftzk3w/) on both YouTube and Facebook.
(Cullen did not respond.)
Later, Martin published [a hit piece (archived)](https://archive.vn/iC02m) regarding Dave Cullen and his channel.
Then, Martin published [a Twitter thread (archived)](https://archive.vn/Rs0DF) towards the end of which he says "FB and YT both removed the video after we flagged it."
So at a minimum, based on Martin's own documented actions and comments, Business Insider is creating its own news.
But on top of that, this demonstrates that they will not only advocate for censorship, but then monetize the story of that very censorship.

### CNBC

* 6 May 2020 - **Advocating For Censorship, Creating Their Own News** -
Sam Shead, a tech correspondent at CNBC, published [a piece (archived)](https://archive.vn/uEyCe) about [Rose/Icke II](https://bigtech.fail/events/youtube-removes-rose-icke-ii/) being removed by Spotify.
In the article, Shead says that the interview was removed "hours after CNBC brought it to the company's attention."
This demonstrates that CNBC will advocate for censorship (possibly to create their own news).

Adele-Momoko Fraser published [this piece (archived)](https://archive.vn/rj36P)
on NBC which [admitted](https://archive.vn/rj36P#selection-1193.0-1197.134)
that NBC's "News Verification Unit" (a real thing) brought the research of the
CCDH (Center for Countering Digital Hate) to Google's attention in order to
have Google take action against The Federalist and ZeroHedge. In other words,
NBC teamed up with a British non-profit to lobby Google to remove two of NBC's
online competitors from Google Ads. And, as it turned out, NBC didn't even get
the original story correct. They claimed the Federalist was totally removed
from Google Ads, causing Google to have to [set the record straight](https://archive.vn/qOjoU).
