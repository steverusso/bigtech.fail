# BigTech.fail

BigTech.fail is an open-source research project aiming to highlight the dangers
of censorship, misinformation and surveillance from today's technology
companies and governments. This is done based on the premise that secrecy and a
lack of information bolster these dangers while transparency and knowledge
challenge them.

## Information Organization

The key information can be organized into separate, but related, sections that
are described below.

### Events

An Event is a summary with source material about something that happened
related to the weaknesses or "failures" of BigTech. This could be, for example,
when:

- an individual is censored, deplatformed, defunded, etc.
- an individual voluntarily leaves a BigTech platform.
- a BigTech platform does something stupid to itself (forms a trust and safety team, forms a supreme court, helps government, etc.)

Events will contain a date, a title, a summary, any Profiles that were
involved, and links to source material.

### Platforms

A Platform is a full report on a BigTech platform that includes a summary, all
of its Events, and what AltTech serves as its alternative(s). The summary could
be, for example, a brief written history highlighting any notable Events in
which the Platform was involved.

### AltTech

An AltTech profile is information about an alternative tech platform. It
contains the platform's name, slogan (if any), data regarding its policies
(ToS, Privacy Policy and Community Guidelines), and a summary that can include
miscellaneous information such as some of it's strengths or weaknesses.

### Profiles

A Profile is data about individuals / organizations that have been the targets
of BigTech abuse. Profiles contain the individual's / organization's _publicly
available_ name (ex: as it appears on their social media accounts), a short
bio, and links to their online presence. Doing this helps to negate the
effectiveness of deplatforming: if someone is kicked off a platform, they can
still have a presence and a voice somewhere else on the internet.

The profile links will be prioritized as follows:

- User-controlled spaces (_their_ website, _their_ independent support mechanism, _their_ merch shop, etc.)
- Third-party support mechanisms (Locals.com, SubscribeStar, etc.)
- AltTech (Minds, BitChute, Brighteon, Gab, etc.)
- BigTech (YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)

There are certain websites / platforms that will be deliberately excluded from
the collection of Profile links:

- **Patreon, PayPal, Venmo**
  - Financial deplatforming messes with people's livlihoods, and it sometimes even goes beyond the actual platforms (ex: Patreon taking certain actions due to pressure from Mastercard). Ideally, we don't want to link to _any_ payment platform that is vulnerable to censorship from banks or payment processors. However, for now, we'll only drop the offenders.
- **Facebook**
  - Out of all the failing Platforms, Facebook seems to be winning the race towards non-existence. We want to do our part to help them out. In all seriousness, this platform's growth rate has decreased significantly. Worse, the increase in censorship has caused Facebook in particular to lose the 'cool' factor with Gen Z. Therefore, no creator should be seeking growth on this platform (if they're even still on it).

## Information Delivery

The primary information channel will be [the website](../website/), and
secondary channels will include AltTech platforms.
