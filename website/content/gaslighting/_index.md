title: Gaslighting
---

**Gaslighting** is a certain type of psychological manipulation that uses
contradiction and/or denial in order to, [according to
Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/gaslighting), "undermine the
victim's confidence in his own ability to distinguish truth from falsehood,
right from wrong, or reality from appearance, thereby rendering him
pathologically dependent on the gaslighter in his thinking or feelings."

Many corporations and governments regularly engage in this practice, and
BigTech is no exception. However, the timing on what seems like comical
propaganda is sometimes so bad that it comes off as unfathomably tone-deaf at
best or just straight taunting at worst.
