Twitter threw a fit after the Ugandan government restricted access to Twitter
during the country's elections. This was after months of Twitter editorializing
& restricting the US President's account as well as suspending several members
of the administration, not to mention [outright suppressing the Hunter Biden
laptop scandal](/t/hunters-laptop/) two weeks before the election.
