The CEO of YouTube [was presented](https://archive.ph/FUasl) with a "Free
Expression" award by an organization called _Freedom Forum_ :clown:. While
accepting this award, the CEO bragged about how much independent content has
been "removed" or "reduced" and how much "authoritative" content has been
"raised" up. In the top right corner of this "awards ceremony" is a caption
that reads: "PRESENTED BY SIGNATURE SPONSOR YouTube."
