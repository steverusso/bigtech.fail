Twitter partially enforced a block order from the Indian government and
annouced that no action was taken on accounts of "media entities, journalists,
activists, and politicians" while over the prior months having silenced people
in each of those categories in the US (during an election). Twitter added that
they "will continue to advocate for the right of free expression", and that
"around the world" they "strongly believe that the Tweets must flow."
