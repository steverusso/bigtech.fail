In response to a claim on Twitter that Amazon "make's workers urinate in
bottles," Amazon said if that were true, no one would work for them! In
response to Amazon, the internet pointed out so much data and reporting to the
contrary, some of which was years old, that Amazon
[apologized](https://archive.ph/yO1kK) for this ridiculous denial.
