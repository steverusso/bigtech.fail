Parler (which means "to speak" in French) is a social networking and
microblogging service. From their [About page](https://home.parler.com/about/):
> Parler provides a Commenting and Social News platform for digital publishers,
> influencers, bloggers, writers, politicians and social users to share news,
> opinions and content in real time. Additionally, we provide enterprise tools
> to enhance online blogs, media and websites with direct social integrations
> and monetization capabilities.

Many conservative figures have joined as they have been increasingly targeted
by BigTech. Near the end of June of 2020, Parler [reached number
one](https://reclaimthenet.org/parler-increase-popularity/) in the "News"
section of Apple's App Store.

It reached number one again in January of 2021 after President Trump and many
of his supporters were purged off of BigTech. It was then [removed from the
Google Play Store](/events/google-removes-parler-from-play-store/) as well as
the [Apple App Store and Amazon Web
Services](/events/apple-removes-parler-from-app-store/).

### Questionable Policy Decisions

As the platform experienced massive growth, it ran into the accompanying
problems. For example, many people see a growing platform as a joke which means
the chance to post obscene content. Parler enforces a fairly strict obscenity
policy. So it turns out that Parler may remove even more types of content than
Twitter, but they'll leave political speech alone (for the most part).

There are [several](http://archive.is/pNJVz) other examples of people having a
bad experience on Parler, including having their account [essentially shut
down](https://archive.is/r90ES) without warning. Regardless, establishment
conservative thought seems to be flourishing. It's possible these negative
experiences are just the growing pains of a fledgling platform. For now, it
does not seem that Parler is a strong alternative platform.
