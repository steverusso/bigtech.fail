DuckDuckGo is an internet privacy company that operates a search engine that
does not collect or store any personal information. They offer [mobile apps and
a browser extension](https://duckduckgo.com/app) that block internet trackers
in order to keep search and browsing history private.

How does a company like this make money if they don't collect and monetize
personal data as Google does? DuckDuckGo explains part of [their revenue
model](https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-revenue-model/):

> We make our money from private ads on our search engine. On other search
> engines, ads are based on profiles compiled about you using your personal
> information like search, browsing, and purchase history. Since we don’t
> collect that information, search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on the search
> results page you are viewing, not on you as a person. For example, if you
> search for cars, we’ll show you ads about cars.
