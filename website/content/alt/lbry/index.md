## Overview

LBRY is a permissionless, censorship-resistant protocol for managing digital
content in a decentralized marketplace. The opening of its [technical
specification](https://lbry.tech/spec) provides a great overview:

> LBRY uses a public blockchain to provide a single shared index of published
> content, as well as content discovery and payment. Clients can use LBRY to
> publish, host, find, download, and pay for content â€” books, movies, music, or
> anything else that can be represented as a stream of bits. The protocol is
> permissionless and censorship-resistant, which means that participation is
> open to everyone and no one can unilaterally block or remove content.

## Philosophy

In an interview shortly after LBRY was [removed from the Google Play
Store](/events/google-removes-lbry-app-from-play-store/), _LBRY Inc._ CEO
Jeremy Kauffman [talked
about](https://odysee.com/@Anarchast:2/LBRY-Banned-from-Google-App-Store-with-CEO-Jeremy-Kauffman:e?r=F2vmyMKsLqg1yr9kntn9yGMxUQggztX6&t=1202)
LBRY's competitive edge of censorship-resistance and how the _need to control
everything_ will likely be why BigTech corporations eventually lose:

> So you want to have some property that the incumbent can't just sort of
> co-opt or take on. And so in our case, one of the fundamental propositions of
> what we built is we have surrendered control. YouTube could claw back a
> little bit by simply adopting better policies, but to fundamentally surrender
> their control I think is something that they will basically never be willing
> to do, or wouldn't do until it's too late.

Kauffman has also been vocal about the inherent dangers, flaws, and hypocrisy
regarding government regulation of tech corporations. Instead, he advocates for
innovating and creating technology that removes censorship as even an option:

> You cannot claim to be against censorship and want to regulate big tech to
> stop them from censoring
>
> That is just support for censorship, but one level higher
>
> The solution to censorship is use technology that makes it impossible
> entirely
