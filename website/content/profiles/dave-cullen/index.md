Dave Cullen runs a channel called _Computing Forever_ that contains various
types of content including technology, gaming, and polical commentary. Dave
does a great job calling out censorship.

In May of 2019, YouTube [removed an
interview](/events/youtube-removes-computing-forever-interview-with-prof-dolores-cahill/)
that Dave had with Prof. Dolores Cahill since it contained views and
information on COVID-19 that were contrary to the World Health Orgnaization's
position.
