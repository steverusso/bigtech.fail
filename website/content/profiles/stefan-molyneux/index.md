Stefan Molyneux is the host of Freedomain, one of the most popular philosophy shows.

Molyneux had his YouTube account
[restricted](/events/youtube-restricts-stefan-molyneux/) in August of 2018 and
was [permanently banned](/events/youtube-bans-stefan-molyneux/) on June 29,
2020.

After his YouTube ban, Molyneux was smeared as a white supremecist who
advocates for eugenics despite
[clearly](https://www.bitchute.com/video/mW3-1L_BSPQ/) speaking out [against
](https://www.bitchute.com/video/J8a1ruVxVv4/) such things.
