Dr. Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychologist, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto, and author of _12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos_.

In January of 2019, [Peterson left Patreon](/events/jordan-peterson-leaves-patreon/), promising to work on a strong free speech alternative.

During June of 2019, Peterson delivered on that promise by [introducing Thinkspot](/events/thinkspot-enters-beta/) and announcing that it was entering public beta testing.
