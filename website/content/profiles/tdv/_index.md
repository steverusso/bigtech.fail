[The Dollar Vigilante](https://dollarvigilante.com/what-is-tdv/) is a financial
news letter firmly grounded in pure free market (anarcho-capitalist) principles
that has "absolutely no illusions about governments and central banks and their
inherent tendency to steal, distort markets and cause physical and economic
destruction." It was founded by Jeff Berwick and Ed Bugos in 2009.
