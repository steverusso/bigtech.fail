Gavin McInnes is the host of [Censored.TV](https://censored.tv/) and founder of
The Proud Boys, an organization that he describes as "a patriotic multiracial
men's drinking fraternity" which has been relentlessly smeared as a hate group
and is a common stated reason for BigTech deplatforming him.

In August of 2018, McInnes and The Proud Boys [were banned from
Twitter](/events/twitter-bans-gavin-and-proud-boys/) along with several other
associated accounts. About two months later, he and The Proud Boys [were banned
from both Facebook and Instagram](/events/facebook-instagram-ban-proud-boys-and-gavin-mcinnes/),
again along with other associated accounts.

In December of 2018, YouTube [terminated his
channel](/events/youtube-bans-gavin-mcinnes-reinstates/) "due to repeated
claims of copyright infringement." However, it was mysteriously reinstated a
few days later. McInnes was eventually [permanently
banned](/events/youtube-bans-gavin-mcinnes/) from YouTube on June 22, 2020 for
no specific reason.
