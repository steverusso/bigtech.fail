CarpeDonktum (aka. Logan Cook) describes himself as the "Eternally Sarcastic
Memesmith" and is perhaps best known as "Donald Trump's favorite meme maker."

CarpeDonktum [was permanently banned](/events/twitter-bans-carpedonktum/) from
Twitter in June of 2020 for "multiple copyright infringement notifications."
The copyright complaints, all bogus since the content is clearly covered by
fair use, were coincidentally filed after Trump tweeted one of CarpeDonktum's
videos that got nearly 20 million views. CarpeDonktum [decided not to
contest](https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1122612088517787648) the complaints.
