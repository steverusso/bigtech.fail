Minds is a social media platform that aims to be decentralized in many key
ways. The platform takes a refreshing, common-sense approach to content
moderation, unapologetically spelled out in the beginning of [their
ToS](https://www.minds.com/p/terms):
> If you find content that is objectionable, then Unsubscribe, Block, Report or
> just swipe on by. Minds is an open, free and public commons where users
> respect the right to use free speech.

## Jury System

Minds uses [a Jury
System](https://www.minds.com/minds/blog/power-to-the-people-the-minds-jury-system-975486713993859072)
to moderate reported content. The system is outlined in their [Content
Policy](https://www.minds.com/content-policy):
> To ensure that decisions are made as democratically as possible, we developed
> a Jury System based on the Santa Clara Principles to review appeals. A Jury
> consists of 12 randomly selected unique active Minds users who are not
> subscribed to the user under review. Each juror selected is provided with the
> option to participate, pass or opt-out of the Jury pool entirely. If 75% or
> more of the Jury members vote to accept the appeal of a strike, the
> administrative action is overturned.
>
> If less than 75% of the Jury members vote accept the appeal, the
> administrative action is upheld. The decision of the Jury will be final.

## Open-Source

Minds is a completely open-source project hosted on
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/minds/minds) with mirrors to

are interested in crypto, the [Minds
Whitepaper](https://cdn-assets.minds.com/front/dist/assets/whitepapers/03_27_18_Minds%20Whitepaper%20V0.1.pdf)
is well worth reading.
