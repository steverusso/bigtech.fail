SubscribeStar is perhaps the most popular alternative for Patreon.
<!--more-->
From their [About page](https://www.subscribestar.com/about):
> At SubscribeStar we believe that every talent deserves to be discovered and rewarded properly so it can continue developing further.

As far as pricing, SubscribeStar charges creators [a flat 5% Service Fee](https://www.subscribestar.com/pricing), as well as Transaction Processing Fees of 2.9% + $0.3 (which go directly to the processing entities).

## Battle Tested

Many individuals and corporations have tried to shutdown SubscribeStar on several occasions.
Yet the platform is still around and growing.

Most notably was when SubscribeStar offered their platform to those who were banned amid the Patreon Purge in December 2018.
This bothered the entities that were trying to defund those banned individuals.
The platform subsequently lost significant functionality due to being banned or legally restricted by many payment processors or payment services.
However, SubscribeStar came back stronger, and has since continued to show resilience.

## "No Big Corp Mukry Policies" (Except One)

It's worth pointing out a slight contradiction in how SubscribeStar markets itself.
The company claims to have "no big corp murky policies", but has a [Terms of Service](https://www.subscribestar.com/tos) that amounts to _over 6,700 words_, more than _double_ Patreon's 3,000 word ToS (as of 1 Jan 2020).
This could be an unintended consequence of the legal troubles that SubscribeStar has gone through for simply trying to be a neutral platform.
However, it's a fact that must be called out, hopefully so that it can be rectified.

On the bright side, their [Community Guildelines](https://www.subscribestar.com/guidelines) are simply 16 bullet points of "Do's and Don'ts" that amount to only about 500 words.
In contrast, Patreon's Community Guidelines total over 2,800 words at the time of this writing. Yikes.
