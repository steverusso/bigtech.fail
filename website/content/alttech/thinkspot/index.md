Thinkspot describes itself as _an intellectual playground for censorship-free discourse_:
it will only remove a user's content or their account if ordered to do so by a US court.

Along with a _relatively_ radical stance on free speech, Thinkspot is bring several other interesting adjustments to social media as we know it.
One example is that comments will have a minimum length of 50 words.
Jordan Peterson, who is backing the platform, says this is so that people will have to put thought into their comments, adding _"Even if you're being a troll, you'll be a quasi-witty troll."_
