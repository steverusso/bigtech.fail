Parler (which means "to speak" in French) is a social networking and
microblogging service. From their [About page](https://home.parler.com/about/):
> Parler provides a Commenting and Social News platform for digital publishers,
> influencers, bloggers, writers, politicians and social users to share news,
> opinions and content in real time. Additionally, we provide enterprise tools
> to enhance online blogs, media and websites with direct social integrations
> and monetization capabilities.

Many conservative figures have joined as they have been increasingly targeted
by BigTech. Near the end of June of 2020, Parler [reached number
one](https://reclaimthenet.org/parler-increase-popularity/) in the "News" section
of Apple's App Store.

The platform has relatively bearable legal policies: the User Agreement,
Privacy Policy and Community Guidelines can all be read within roughly 30
minutes.

At the time of this writing, it seems you must be logged into an account in
order to view any content on Parler. Hopefully this will be addressed as the
platform continues to grow.
