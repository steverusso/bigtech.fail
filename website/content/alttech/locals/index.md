Locals is _"a subscription-based community solution that gives power to creators, not platforms."_
Creators can:
- Post videos, photos, podcasts, messages, and polls.
- Sell tickets to events.
- Offer exclusive content to their supporters.

Making an account takes less than 30 seconds.
Once registered, users can then create a community (a "Local").
Creators are in control of their Local: they get to set the terms, content moderation, etc.

While the site's ToS and Privacy Policy are absurdly long, there are two things that somewhat offset that:
1. They offer a ["TL;DR"](https://locals.com/tldr) that attempts to summarize said absurdly long policies.
2. Their [Community Guidelines](https://locals.com/community-guidelines) policy is relatively human readable and only takes a few minutes to read through entirely.
