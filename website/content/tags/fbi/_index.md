   q: 'The federal law enforcement arm becoming a weapons arm of the Democratic
	     party is by a mile the most dangerous thing happening in the United Stats
			 of America today, and it''s like number 100 on everybody''s list. They do
			 not understand the danger that comes from that. Go read the Stasi, go
			 read the NKVD, I know that sounds extreme, that''s how that ends.'
