The New York Post triggered a flurry of BigTech censorship after dropping an
exposé on Hunter Biden titled [_"Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden
introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP
dad"_](https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/).
This article contained allegations which the Senate Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee
[confirmed](https://archive.is/JOKqx#selection-2027.0-2027.190) they were
investigating shortly after publication. The evidence supporting these
allegations was recovered from one of Hunter's laptops that he dropped off at a
computer repair shop in Delaware and never retrieved.

Facebook and Twitter moved quickly to [limit the
distribution](/events/facebook-twitter-suppress-nypost-hunter-expose/) of the
article. Twitter not only blocked the link itself from being posted at all, but
also suspended any account that previously tweeted it out including the New
York Post, which remained suspended for over two weeks because they refused to
delete the tweet containing the link to their article.

The very next day, [Twitter suppressed a follow-up
article](/events/twitter-suppresses-nypost-followup-on-hunter-corruption-in-china/)
published by the New York Post regarding Hunter Biden's corruption in China.
