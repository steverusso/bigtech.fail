   q: 'A handful of Silicon Valley oligarchs decide who can and cannot be heard,
       including the President of the United States. They exert this power
       unilaterally, with no standards, accountability or appeal.

       Politics now is begging them to silence adversaries or permit allies to
       speak:'

   q: 'The capitol riot did not happen because we didn''t have enough censorship.
       That is a ridiculous idea. [...] I don''t understand how the left has to keep
       learning this over and over and over. And you know, the first person to be
       deplatformed was Wikileaks and Julian Assange.'

On January 6, 2021, as the US Congress was in session to certify the results of
the 2020 Presidential election, tens of thousands of people showed up in the
nation's capitol to protest what they believed was a fraudulent election. As
the day went on, the protestors (now rioters) clashed with police, broke
through barriers and eventually stormed the capitol building, which immediately
went into lockdown. These escalations [led to the deaths of four
protestors](https://archive.is/He8Fp#selection-375.0-379.114), both directly
and indirectly.

Politicians and other establishment figures immediately started calling this an
insurrection incited by President Trump despite him explicitly advocating for
peace. BigTech immediately did their part in helping to bolster this false
narrative starting with [Facebook removing any videos or photos of the
riots](https://reclaimthenet.org/facebook-bans-capitol-protest-photos-videos/)
as well as [multiple platforms suspending the
President](/events/twitter-facebook-suspend-trump/). These suspensions were
later upgraded to [permanent bans](/events/twitter-bans-trump/) and expanded to
include [journalists who were simply reporting on the
events](/events/facebook-instagram-ban-elijah-schaffer/) taking place.

However, it got much worse as users began to flee these platforms en masse
(which caused free speech platforms such as Parler and Minds to experience
record breaking traffic). Parler trended as the #1 app in Apple's App Store
until [Google and Apple removed Parler's mobile app from their app
stores](/events/google-removes-parler-from-play-store/) and [Amazon disabled
Parler's web servers](/events/apple-removes-parler-from-app-store/), taking the
site completely offline. About a week later, Minds was forced to significantly
[reduce their mobile app
functionality](/events/google-play-threatens-minds-with-suspension/) in order
to avoid facing the same fate as Parler.
