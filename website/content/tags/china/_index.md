A few events here or there where BigTech censorship happens to favor China
wouldn't be cause for concern (to most). However, as the cases mount, the
pattern becomes quite clear.

The scary thing is that many of these services and platforms aren't even
available in China, and if they are, it's not in the same form as in other
(freer) countries. It's almost as if BigTech is auditioning for access to the
Chinese markets by showing off their censorship abilities to the CCP (Chinese
Communist Party).

Alternatively, it cannot be ruled out that these corporations have already been
infiltrated by the CCP. For example, Facebook's ~~Thought Police~~ [Hate-Speech
Engineering team](https://archive.is/ox7Zi) contains several members who lived
in and were educated in China before being hired by the company.
