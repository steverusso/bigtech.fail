A couple of events where BigTech censorship happens to favor China wouldn't be
cause for concern (to most). However, as the cases mount, the pattern becomes
quite clear.

The scary thing is that many of these services and platforms aren't available
in China, and if they are, it's not in the same form as in other, freer
countries. It's almost as if BigTech is auditioning for access to the Chinese
markets by trying to impress its authoritarian government.
