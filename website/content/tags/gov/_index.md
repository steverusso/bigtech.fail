BigTech and Government are deeply intertwined with one another, and [China is
balls-deep in both](/tags/china/). We define government related events to be
**anytime government and BigTech cross paths**. For example, this could be a
BigTech corporation censoring at the request of a government or even censoring
a current politician or political figure.
