Most if not all of the BigTech corporations make a lot of money by selling
advertising space. Users (typically organizations) spend money to advertise on
these platforms in order to increase their reach and subsequent growth. A
platform can suspend an account's ability to advertise if that account violates
the terms of service (or, in reality, if they don't agree with the politics of
a certain account).
