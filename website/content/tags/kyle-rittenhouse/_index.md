On August 25, 2020, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse went to Kenosha, Wisconsin on
the third night of rioting to help clean up graffiti and administer first-aid.
Although he lived in Antioch, Illinois, he worked in Kenosha as a lifeguard.

Throughout the night, Kyle offered help to injured protestors. At one point,
rioters started a dumpster fire in a gas station.  Kyle can be seen running
with a fire extinguisher to the gas station where the fire was then put out
before causing significant damage. This angered the mob and led to Kyle fleeing
in order to avoid major conflict.

Retreating did not work as he was chased, threatened, and assaulted by several
convicted felons from the mob, including one armed with a handgun. Kyle killed
two and injured one. He was arrested two days later and charged with
intentional homicide.
