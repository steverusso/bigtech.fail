Shadow banning is when a platform limits a user's reach without that user
knowing. For example, if a user makes a post, that post will only be visible to
that user and potentially no one else. BigTech has actually been caught several
times shadow banning by country (meaning accounts where removed from search
results _only for users in the US_).
