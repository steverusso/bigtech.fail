Content removed is when digital material is scrubbed by an online platform for
any reason that isn't the result of [banning](/tags/banned/) or
[suspending](/tags/suspended/) an individual or organization. Some examples:
YouTube removes a video, Twitter removes a tweet, Facebook removes a post, etc.
