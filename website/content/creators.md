title: Protecting Yourself As a Content Creator

Using alternative platforms isn't about damaging the BigTech platforms; it's primarily about protecting yourself.
When the powers-that-be start practicing censorship, it's only a matter of time until you or your business is affected.

Therefore, no matter who you are, it might be wise to begin looking for ways to increase your resilience to censorship and deplatforming.
(**Note:** this is especially important when it comes to finance.
For example, check out our [report on Patreon](/patreon/).
As [Tim Pool put it](http://web.archive.org/web/20181220180948/https:/twitter.com/Timcast/status/1075390036328308737): "Ban someone from Twitter and people grumble. Strip someones income and people panic.")

Ideally, we would all use infrastructure that we completely control.
While that is likely the future, a good intermediate step is to leverage alternative tech platforms that have taken a strong stance against censorship and deplatforming.
Below are some suggestions for how to most effectively do that.

## Make AltTech-Exclusive Content

Perhaps the least effective way to leverage alternative platforms is to use them as a backup / archival service.
On the other hand, they can be very effectively used as... _platforms_.
In other words, use them to actually interact with even just a portion of your audience.

One of the best ways of encouraging your audience to try AltTech is to publish a portion of your content _only_ on a specific platform and not on your usual platform(s).
For example, creator [Styxhexenhammer666](/profiles/styxhexenhammer666/) releases about four videos each day, one of which is only published on BitChute.
He has been doing this for a while and, not coincidently, has the largest account on BitChute by subscriber count at the time of this writing.

## Promote Your AltTech Accounts

Yes, it's that simple.
Let your audience know about your presence on alternative platforms: post the links when you publish content (for example, in video descriptions), tweet them out, put them in your newsletters, etc.
Diversifying how you reach an audience won't accomplish much if no one knows about it.
