## Research

BigTech.fail started tracking events near the middle of 2019. Therefore, some
events that occured many years prior are difficult to corroborate due to a lack
of evidence. Either the events received little or no media attention, or the
main source material isn't easily found (such as an unarchived tweet by a
banned user). However, it is necessary to gather this material in order to
properly record the events in question.

We track such events by using [GitHub issues labeled as "missing
info."](https://github.com/steverusso/bigtech.fail/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22missing+info%22)
If you believe you can help fill in any missing information for those events,
please feel free to comment on those issues (if you have a GitHub account) or
email us at [info@bigtech.fail](mailto:info@bigtech.fail) as long as it is
understood that no attribution will be given for these communications.
