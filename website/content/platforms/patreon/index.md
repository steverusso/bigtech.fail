Patreon is a financial services platform that has a history of stepping outside their own ToS and banning people for political reasons.
Perhaps this is no wonder: between their
[Terms of Use](https://www.patreon.com/policy/legal),
[Community Guidelines](https://www.patreon.com/policy/guidelines),
[Benefit Guidelines](https://www.patreon.com/policy/benefits),
[Privacy Policy](https://privacy.patreon.com/policies?name=privacy-policy#our-data-retention-period) and
[Cookie Policy](https://www.patreon.com/policy/cookies),
there's about an hour and 15 minutes (over 11k words) of legalese.
On top of all that, they are even willing to take marching orders from third parties, such as Mastercard, as we saw with [the Robert Spencer ban](/events/patreon-bans-robert-spencer/).

## Notable Events

### The Lauren Southern Ban

[The Lauren Southern ban](/events/patreon-bans-lauren-southern/) was perhaps the first controversial Patreon ban, the canary in the coal mine.
However, the _long term_ significance of this event actually came a few weeks later when Patreon CEO Jack Conte [made an appearance on The Rubin Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofpbDgCj9rw) to elaborate on why they banned Lauren.
He stressed, again and again, that Patreon's policies apply <u>only to what happens on Patreon, not what happens on other platforms</u>.

### The Sargon Ban

[The Sargon of Akkad ban](/events/patreon-bans-sargon/) was highly controversial, mainly because he was banned for using a bad word on someone else's YouTube channel about a year prior.
This controversy sparked a chain of events, including
[Sam Harris leaving the platform](/events/sam-harris-leaves-patreon/),
[Jordan Peterson leaving](/events/jordan-peterson-leaves-patreon/) and eventually [launching Thinkspot](/events/thinkspot-enters-beta/),
[Dave Rubin leaving](/events/dave-rubin-leaves-patreon/) and eventually launching Locals.com,
and even the inception of Patreon.fail (this site's predecessor).
