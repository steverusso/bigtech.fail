:warning: **Flote is in beta.**

Flote is a new form of social media that offers streaming, encrypted messaging,
subscriptions, and superchats. Additionally, they have a list of features
coming soon including community boards, group messaging, and storefronts.

Flote is [committed](http://archive.is/XDbUZ) to creating and leveraging
decentralized technology which increases everyone's resistence to censorship.
As far as money, the platform currently offers the option to use Bitcoin, and
there are plans to support additional cryptocurrencies as well.

Flote does not codify concepts like "hate speech" or "hateful content" or
"misleading information." In fact, there are only seven rules on Flote:

> 1. No spam
> 2. No doxxing
> 3. No malware
> 4. No username squatting
> 5. NSFW tag. If the imagery is in a user's avatar or header image, #NSFW must
>    be placed in the user's bio.
> 6. Impersonation accounts are not allowed. Parody accounts must be marked as
>    such in a userâ€™s display name, username, or bio.
> 7. You must be at least 13 years of age to create a Flote account.
