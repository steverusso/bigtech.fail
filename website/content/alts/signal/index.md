[Signal](https://signal.org/download/) is a simple, end-to-end encrypted
messenger focused on privacy.
<!--more-->

While the setup process is very quick and easy, **Signal does require a phone
number in order to register**. Signal has mobile clients (for both Android and
iOS) as well as desktop clients for Windows, Mac and some Linux distros (the
package is typically named `signal-desktop`). Linking across devices is as
simple as scanning a QR code.

All of Signal's applications have the ability to make audio and video calls.
Signal uses [private contact
discovery](https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/) to determine who
in your contacts is a Signal user _without revealing any data_ to Signal
itself.

Signal is open source with [everything being hosted on
GitHub](https://github.com/signalapp).

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg [has used or uses
Signal](https://archive.ph/BKRZJ)! Check out a nice comparison of [Signal vs
Facebook Messenger vs WhatsApp](https://archive.is/b1Fx9).
