Locals is _"a subscription-based community solution that gives power to creators, not platforms."_
Creators can:
- Post videos, photos, podcasts, messages, and polls.
- Sell tickets to events.
- Offer exclusive content to their supporters.

Making an account takes less than 30 seconds.
Once registered, users can then create a community (a "Local").
Creators are in control of their Local: they get to set the terms, content moderation, etc.

While the site's ToS and Privacy Policy are absurdly long, there are two things that somewhat offset that:
1. They offer a ["TL;DR"](https://locals.com/tldr) that attempts to summarize said absurdly long policies.
2. Their [Community Guidelines](https://locals.com/community-guidelines) policy is relatively human readable and only takes a few minutes to read through entirely.

On October 19, 2020, author and media personality [Michael
Malice](https://malice.locals.com/) explained to Locals.com founder Dave Rubin
[why he prefers](https://www.bitchute.com/video/tlFsvbDEf1E/) Locals over
Patreon:

> I was on Patreon before, and here are the advantages I had with Locals. I do
> not ever have to worry that I'm going to make a video or sent out a tweet and
> have everything I've created vanished overnight. I don't have to worry about
> not having a recourse. ... Second, the vibe of Locals is this was a place
> where me and people who like what I do and respect what I do are welcomed as
> ooposed to being regarded as something to put up with and an embarassment and
> something to apologize about.
