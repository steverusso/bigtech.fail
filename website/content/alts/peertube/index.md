PeerTube is an [open-source](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube) and
decentralized video hosting platform powered by
[ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) and
[WebTorrent](https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent). In other words, it is a
network of video providers, and anyone can become one. From the PeerTube home
page:

> Anyone with a modicum of technical skills can host a PeerTube server, aka an
> instance. Each instance hosts its users and their videos. In this way, every
> instance is created, moderated and maintained independently by various
> administrators.

Especially useful (if you're going to try setting up your own server, which you
should try if you have any technical skills!) is his video tutorial on [setting
up a web and email server "in one
sitting."](https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/591bf5dd-b02f-40f7-a2cc-b4929c52cb51)
From there, you might be able to follow [the PeerTube guide on creating an
instance](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube#package-create-your-own-instance),
or you can search elsewhere online for a different type of guide / tutorial.
