MeWe is an alternative social media platform (most similar to Facebook) that
makes a strong commitment to privacy in regards to user data. The platform also
doesn't "boost" or algorithmically manipulate posts, so your newsfeed simply is
what it is in chronological order.

However, MeWe does take some concerning stances when it comes to content
moderation. For example, [right in the beginning of their Terms of
Service](https://archive.is/YN39F#selection-2203.0-2207.75), they state that
they will remove content that is "hateful" or "misleading", unlike other
alternative platforms such as [Minds](/alt/minds/) or [Flote](/alt/flote/) that
don't codify such loose concepts that have been used to justify the removal of
untold amounts of content on BigTech "platforms":

> [...] We want MeWe to be convenient, safe, and fun for you and your
> communities. This means there are a few rules. You may NOT:
>
> Post content that is hateful, threatening, harmful, incites violence; or
> contains graphic or gratuitous violence.
>
> Use MeWe to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.
>
> [...]

Additionally, on an episode of a podcast called the Source Code Podcast, MeWe's
founder and CEO Mark Weinstein [talked
about](https://archive.is/RH2jX#selection-1865.5-1865.691) how they have a
"laundry list" of platform rules and "a great Trust and Safety Team" to enforce
them. (Stop me if this sounds familiar.)

> I'm not [an] anything-goes guy, I want to be very clear. This is a clear
> distinction between MeWe and Parler or 8chan. I think sites where anything
> goes are terrible, terrible. At MeWe we have strict rules in our terms about
> inciting violence — you better not do it — about posting hate, about
> bullying, breaking the law. We have a laundry list. And we have a great Trust
> and Safety team, we have Report and Block on every post and every profile and
> every group and every page, and our Trust and Safety team will investigate.
> We're for the good guys. But we're not going to censor a conversation by
> conservatives or progressives, or health advocates of one health remedy
> versus another.

Finally, [in their ToS](https://archive.is/YN39F#selection-2251.0-2255.181),
MeWe explicitly reserves the right to "suspend or terminate your account" if
the platform "reasonably believes" that you broke their rules, and there is a
similiar standard for pages and groups:

> We may suspend or terminate your account or cease providing you with all or
> part of the Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not
> limited to, if we reasonably believe you have violated these Terms.
>
> MeWe reserves the right to ban Pages, Groups and users that do not comply
> with its Terms of Service as assessed in MeWe’s sole discretion and
> interpretation of its Terms of Service;

The CEO certainly gets at least one thing right though. [In an
interview](https://www.bitchute.com/video/JMZK5PN7Z8U/) with [Mark
Dice](/profiles/mark-dice/), Mark Weinstein talked about the importance of
letting the free market solve the problem and avoiding the trap of government
regulation:

> What we have to do is we have to vote. We have to vote by getting off these
> platforms. The free market is the only thing that can work to get this
> straightened out. Let's not look for government regulation. That's just going
> to institutionalize surveillance capitalism.
