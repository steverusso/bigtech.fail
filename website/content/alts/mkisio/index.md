MKISIO ([typically pronounced _muh kiss eee oh_](https://mkis.io/the-story/))
is an email newsletter service that has made commitments to free speech and
privacy.

> Your lists, your content, your schedule. Nothing is ever shared, except by
> you. Simple monitoring, and no hidden tracking. Tough encryption is available
> too. Your community.

### Encryption to Strengthen Privacy

MKISIO encrypts their customers' email lists and additionally offers the option
to encrypt the email content as well:

> Maybe your subscribers are the paranoid type. Nowadays that's normal. [...]
> That's why MKISIO encrypts all email lists, on a per-publication basis, so
> your subscribers' information is safe. You of course always have unbridled
> access to it, MKISIO stepping aside so you can maintain your relationships
> without interference.

> [...] we can also provide you a way to make sure only people on your list can
> read what you send.

### Commitment to Free Speech

Below is the main part of MKISIO's [commitment to free
speech](https://mkis.io/commitment/):

> The content within email newsletters publishers send and subscribers receive
> is none of MKISIO's business, with the sole exception being content that
> violates some law (like copyright, trademark or involvement of minors).
> Outside of conveying material that is outside the bounds of the law (and
> would generally include MKISIO receiving legal notice from a legal-type
> person that some law might be being broken), we leave the speech up to you.
