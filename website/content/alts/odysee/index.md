Odysee is a video-hosting platform that uses the LBRY protocol.
<!--more-->

The platform is a bit more centralized than if you were to interact with the
LBRY network directly. This means the platform has more control over certain
things, such as user registration and content moderation. However, this results
in a much more familiar and user-friendly experience because it is then easy to
implement really useful features such as referral infrastructure, the ability
to like or dislike videos, and the ability to block and mute channels (all of
which Odysee has).

## Prohibited Content - Brief Overview

[Odysee's community
guidelines](https://odysee.com/@OdyseeHelp:b/Community-Guidelines:c) are short
and to the point. They can be read in their entirety within a minute or two.
However, there is some concerning language in the types of prohibited content
which are listed, as follows, at the end of those community guidelines:

* Content that incites hatred or violence towards a particular group
* Content that incites violence towards a particular group or person
* Content that promotes terrorism
* Excessive bullying of persons not well known within the public sphere
* Pornographic material
* Animal abuse
* Torture videos
* Copyright-infringing material

What is "inciting hatred"? Exactly how much "bullying" is "excessive"? How do
they define "well known within the public square"? These might seem like
nit-picky questions, but it is precisely this kind of language in these kinds
of policies that is so blatantly easy to abuse.

## Decentralization

Luckily, if Odysee ever does actually abuse their own policies, users can
interact with the LBRY network directly since content uploaded and published on
Odysee is also published on the LBRY network.

In [an interview](https://odysee.com/@NaomiBrockwell:4/Odysee-is-great:a) with
journalist and producer Naomi Brockwell, the CEO of Odysee Jeremy Kauffman
talked about how using the LBRY protocol fundamentally changes the game of
content hosting in regards to trust:

> We're not even asking you to trust us that we won't be evil. It's all open.
> If we become evil, good people can take over immediately. That's what so
> beautiful about this idea.
