Brave is a privacy-focused web browswer that blocks ads and trackers.

Similar to other browsers, Brave has the ability to use "private" windows (also
known as "incognito" windows in Chrome even though they are not at all
incognito). However, Brave also comes with the ability to use a private window
that uses [Tor (The Onion Router)](https://www.torproject.org/):

> Brave lets you use Tor right in a tab. Tor not only hides your history, it
> masks your location from the sites you visit by routing your browsing through
> several servers before it reaches your destination. These connections are
> encrypted to increase anonymity.

In January of 2021, Brave [added native
support](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-01-19-ipfs-in-brave/) for [IPFS
(Interplanetary File System)](https://ipfs.io/), which is essentially a
protocol for a decentralized web:

> [...] for those who desperately need a resilient internet that puts them in
> control of their online experiences, IPFS is now just one-click to install in
> the Brave browser.

In March of 2021, Brave [announced](https://brave.com/brave-search/) that they
had acquired a search engine called _Tailcat_, and that it "will become the
foundation" of the forthcoming Brave Search.
