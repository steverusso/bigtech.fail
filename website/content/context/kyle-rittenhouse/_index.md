On August 25, 2020, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse went to Kenosha, WI, where he
worked as a lifeguard, on the third night of rioting to help clean up graffiti
and tend to injured protestors. At one point, rioters started a dumpster fire
in a gas station, and Kyle can be seen running with a fire extinguisher to the
gas station where the fire was then put out before causing significant damage.
This angered the mob and led to Kyle fleeing in order to avoid conflict
escalation. This did not work as he was chased, threatened, and assaulted by
several convicted felons from the mob, including one armed with a handgun. Kyle
killed two and injured one.
