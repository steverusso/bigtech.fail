Patreon is a financial services platform that has a history of stepping outside
their own ToS and banning people for political reasons. Perhaps this is no
wonder: between their [Terms of Use](https://www.patreon.com/policy/legal),
[Community Guidelines](https://www.patreon.com/policy/guidelines), [Benefit
Guidelines](https://www.patreon.com/policy/benefits), [Privacy
Policy](https://privacy.patreon.com/policies?name=privacy-policy#our-data-retention-period)
and [Cookie Policy](https://www.patreon.com/policy/cookies), there's about an
hour and 15 minutes (over 11k words) of legalese.

Perhaps what is most disturbing is that at the end of the day, Patreon takes
marching orders from third parties, such as Mastercard, as we saw with [the
Robert Spencer ban](/events/patreon-bans-robert-spencer/). Many other
corporations find themselves in similar situations where the main payment
processor runs the show.
