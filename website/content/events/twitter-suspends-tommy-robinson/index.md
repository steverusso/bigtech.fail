Twitter temporarily suspended Tommy Robinson, a British political activist, for
a week after he tweeted:
> 90% of grooming gang convictions are Muslims

Shortly after being suspended, Robinson
[said](https://archive.vn/4QPZI#selection-439.0-443.230) this was the start of
being completely deplatformed from Twitter. Less than a month later, Twitter
[permanently banned him](/e/twitter-bans-tommy-robinson/).
