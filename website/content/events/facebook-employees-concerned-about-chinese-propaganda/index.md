Some Facebook employees starting voicing concerns about the Chinese government
using Facebook to spread propaganda. Newley Purnell for The Wall Street Journal
[reported](https://archive.ph/Ja0oh#selection-387.0-387.363):

> Now, some Facebook staff are raising concerns on internal message boards and
> in other employee discussions that the company is being used as a conduit for
> state propaganda, highlighting sponsored posts from Chinese organizations
> that purport to show Muslim ethnic minority Uyghurs thriving in Chinaâ€™s
> Xinjiang region, according to people familiar with the matter.
