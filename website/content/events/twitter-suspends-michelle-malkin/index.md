Twitter suspended Michelle Malkin, conservative commentator and activist, five
days after she tweeted the following during the early onset of the George Floyd
riots:

> In case I wasn't clear: Violent criminal looters should be shot.

The suspension was for 12 hours for violating Twitter's "rules against abuse
and harassment."
