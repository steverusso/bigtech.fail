In an update to their Terms of Service, the Facebook owned
messenging app WhatsApp announced that they would be requiring users to consent
to having their data and information shared with Facebook. As [Engadget
reported](https://archive.is/bYPHF#selection-1489.0-1493.163):

> In a surprise move, WhatsApp recently gave many of its users a difficult
> choice: they could either accept a revised privacy policy that explicit
> allowed the service to share information with parent company Facebook by
> February 8th, or decline and risk not being able to use the service at all.

Shortly after this gathered media attention, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk
[tweeted](https://archive.is/l7v1x) "Use Signal", is a [privacy focused
messenger](https://signal.org/). This caused Signal to experience rapid, record
breaking growth. As [Reuters
reported](https://archive.is/ouLPZ#selection-403.0-403.227):

> Signal was downloaded by 17.8 million users over the past seven days, a
> 62-fold rise from the prior week, according to data from Sensor Tower.
> WhatsApp was downloaded by 10.6 million users during the same period, a 17%
> decline.

Similarly, another privacy focused messenger [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
saw record breaking growth around this time. Telegram's founder Pavel Durov
talked about the record level growth in his Telegram channel:

> In the first week of January, Telegram surpassed 500 million monthly active
> users. After that it kept growing: 25 million new users joined Telegram in
> the last 72 hours alone. These new users came from across the globe – 38%
> from Asia, 27% from Europe, 21% from Latin America and 8% from MENA.

Telegram ended up being the number one downloaded mobile app (overall) for the
month of January [according to Sensor Tower](https://archive.is/ep9cO).
