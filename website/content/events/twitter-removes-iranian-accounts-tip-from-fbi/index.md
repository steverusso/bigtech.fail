[Twitter](/twitter/) announced the removal of 130 accounts that they said
"appeared" to be Iranian and that were trying to **"disrupt the public
conversation during the first 2020 US Presidential Debate."** Twitter did this
based on a lead from the FBI.

> Based on intel provided by the @FBI, last night we removed approximately 130

As usual, Twitter felt the need to [publicly thank the
FBI](https://archive.is/qEfRh#selection-1163.0-1175.40) and claimed they would
later add these accounts to their permissioned archive:

> [...] As standard, the accounts and their content will be published in full
> once our investigation is complete. Weâ€™re providing this notice to keep
> people updated in real time about our actions. We wish to thank the @FBI for
> their assistance. [...]
