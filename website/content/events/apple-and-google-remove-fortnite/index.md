Epic Games, the company behind the game _Fortnite_, announced the "Fortnite
Mega Drop" which introduced 20% savings on "V-bucks" (Fortnite's in-game
currency). The 20% price drop was the result of Epic Games establishing a
system of direct user payments from within the Fortnite app, allowing them to
completely bypass paying the 30% fee that Apple and Google collect from all
in-app purchases. Shortly after this announcement, both
[Apple](http://archive.is/OtvaU#selection-1149.0-1159.654) and
[Google](http://archive.is/OtvaU#selection-1163.0-1169.468) removed the
Fortnite app from their app stores since direct user payments are a clear ToS
violation for both the App Store and Google Play:
> Epic Games has defied the App Store Monopoly. In retaliation, Apple is
> blocking Fortnite from a billion devices. 
>
> Visit [fn.gg/freefortnite](http://fn.gg/freefortnite) and join the fight to
> stop 2020 from becoming "1984"

> Fortnite is currently unavailable on Google Play. More information will be
> forthcoming soon.

Later that day, Epic took [legal
action](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/apple-complaint-734589783.pdf) by filing
a complaint for injuctive relief which accused Apple of anti-competitive
business practices. The next day, Apple told Epic that their developer account
would be deleted on August 28 if the company was not in compliance with the
Apple Developer Program License Agreement. This caused Epic [to
file](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/epic-v-apple-8-17-20-768927327.pdf) for a
temporary restraining order on the 17th to prevent Apple from taking further
adverse action against the company.
> Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store and has informed Epic that on
> Friday, August 28 Apple will terminate all our developer accounts and cut
> Epic off from iOS and Mac development tools. We are asking the court to stop

Opinion: Epic is clearly in violation of their agreement with Apple and will
very likely lose (if this even reaches the inside of a court room). However,
situations like this should highlight for the rest of us the **dangers of using
and supporting highly-centralized services, especially app stores**.

In the meantime, since Apple didn't remove Fortnite from phones that already
had it installed, iPhones with Fortnite were being listed for [up to
$15,000](http://archive.is/GKTKg) on eBay.
