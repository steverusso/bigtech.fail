This is almost certainly YouTube's biggest fail of 2019.

It started on May 30th when Carlos Maza, a Vox employee, [claimed on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gaywonk/status/1134264395717103617) that he was the victim of targeted harassment from Steven Crowder and his followers and asked YouTube to remove Crowder's channel.

On May 31, Crowder [released a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbpbsY7qVQ) which **warned** that Vox is trying to have his content censored.
On June 4, KEEMSTAR **warned** [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1135925756939382785) that Maza was trying to start another Adpocalypse over "hurt feelings."

Later on June 4, [YouTube tweeted](https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1136055351885815808) that none of Crowder's content violated their policies.

In a remotely sane world, this controversy would have ended there.
However, after Maza threw another tantrum, YouTube decided to appease him by demonetizing dozens of channels ([Crowder's in particular](https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1136341801109843968)).

Shockingly, YouTube couldn't even do this correctly.
The blanket demonetization was so poorly executed that channels [having nothing to do with politics](https://twitter.com/Timcast/status/1136970188769898498) or "hate speech" [were caught up](https://twitter.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1136364526352445440) in the whole fiasco.
The best is that this [_wasn't even enough_ for Maza](https://twitter.com/gaywonk/status/1136342694442217472).

When the dust settled, YouTube had:
1. failed to demonetize the appropriate channels.
2. failed to appease Carlos Maza.
3. failed to actually hurt Crowder financially because this controversy actually caused more people to [join MugClub in a single weekend](https://youtu.be/HpwmWpPZUA0?t=27) than had joined over the company's history.

In fact, five days later, Crowder comically [named Maza employee of the month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpwmWpPZUA0) for "moving more MugClub memberships than anyone in the history of the company."
