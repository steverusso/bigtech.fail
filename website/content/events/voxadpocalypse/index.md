This is almost certainly YouTube's biggest fail of 2019. It started on May 30th
when Carlos Maza, a Vox employee, [claimed](https://archive.vn/YVJsA) that he
was the victim of targeted harassment from Steven Crowder and his followers and
asked YouTube to remove Crowder's channel.

On May 31, Crowder released a video which
[warned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQbpbsY7qVQ) that Vox is trying to
have his content censored. On June 4, KEEMSTAR
[warned](https://archive.is/4tmwS) that Maza was
trying to start another Adpocalypse over "hurt feelings." Later on June 4,
[YouTube tweeted](https://archive.is/YcTL4) that none of Crowder's content
violated their policies.

In a remotely sane world, this controversy would have ended there. However,
after Maza threw another tantrum, YouTube decided to appease him by
demonetizing dozens of channels ([Crowder's in
particular](https://archive.is/D56bb)).

Shockingly, YouTube couldn't even do this correctly. The blanket demonetization
was so poorly executed that channels having nothing to do with politics or
"hate speech" were caught up in the whole fiasco.

The best is that none of this [was enough for Maza](https://archive.is/3rkfP).
When the dust settled, YouTube had:
1. failed to demonetize the appropriate channels.
2. failed to appease Carlos Maza.
3. failed to actually hurt Crowder financially because this controversy
	 actually caused more people to [join MugClub in a single
	 weekend](https://youtu.be/HpwmWpPZUA0?t=27) than had joined over the
	 company's history.

In fact, five days later, Crowder comically [named Maza employee of the
month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpwmWpPZUA0) for "moving more MugClub
memberships than anyone in the history of the company." Crowder's channel was
[re-monetized](https://www.bitchute.com/video/J27FHJ5XxEo/) a little over a
year later.
