[Facebook](/facebook/) banned the _Robinhood Stock Traders_ group, the largest
community of Robinhood traders on Facebook, for "adult sexual exploitation"
violations. The group had a number of members who were participating in the
coordinated short squeezing efforts of the r/wallstreetbets sub-reddit.
[Reuters reported](https://archive.is/ql5PB#selection-383.0-395.132):

> Allen Tran, a 23-year-old from Chicago who created Robinhood Stock Traders,
> said he woke up on Wednesday to a notification that Facebook had disabled the
> 157,000-member group. The notification, seen by Reuters, said without detail
> that the group violated policies on “adult sexual exploitation”.
>
> “We were first on the picking tree to be cut off because we are on Facebook,
> not a free platform like Reddit,” said Tran, referring to the typically
> lighter moderation on the discussion website.

The group was reinstated about a day later without an explanation from
Facebook. [Reuters also
noted](https://archive.is/ql5PB#selection-415.0-415.213) that the group had
mistakenly been suspended and labelled a "dangerous organisation" earlier in
the month.
