YouTube demonetized _Franc Analysis_, a progressive political talk
show, even though the channel wasn't even monetized to begin with.

> I haven't even been monetized for 2 months and @YouTube just demonetized me.
> This is absolutely unfair and predatory for a corporation to go after a small
> channel like mine who only just began to grow.

Franco, the host of _Franc Analysis_, also mentioned how YouTube had been
placing links to QAnon on his videos even if he doesn't mention QAnon at all in
them:

> I forgot to mention this in my stream. They keep putting Q Anon Wikipedia
> page links to videos that aren't associated with Q Anon or don't even mention
> it or say Q Anon is stupid.
