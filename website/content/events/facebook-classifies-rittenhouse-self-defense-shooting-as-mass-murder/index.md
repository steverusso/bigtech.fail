Brian Fishman, the head of Counter Terrorism and Dangerous Organizations at
Facebook, posted a thread on Twitter stating that Facebook classified [the Kyle
Rittenhouse shooting](/context/kyle-rittenhouse/) as "a mass murder" and
removed Kyle Rittenhouse's accounts from both Facebook and Instagram.
Additionally, he announced that any "praise and support" of Kyle Rittenhouse
would be censored:
> I have a brief thread on the tragic shootings in Kenosha, based on findings
> from FB’s initial internal investigation. 1/n
>
> Yesterday we designated the shooting as a mass murder and removed the
> shooter’s accounts from Facebook & Instagram. Per standard practice in these
> situations, we are also removing praise and support of the shooter and have
> also blocked searches of his name on our platforms. 2/n
