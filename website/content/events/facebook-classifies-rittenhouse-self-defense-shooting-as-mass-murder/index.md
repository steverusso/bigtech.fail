On August 25, 2020, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse went to Kenosha, WI, where he
worked as a lifeguard, on the third night of rioting to help clean up graffiti
and tend to injured protestors. At one point, rioters started a dumpster fire
in a gas station, and Kyle can be seen running with a fire extinguisher to the
gas station where the fire was then put out before causing significant damage.
This angered the mob and led to Kyle fleeing in order to avoid conflict
escalation.  This did not work as he was chased, threatened, and assaulted by
several convicted felons from the mob, including one armed with a handgun. Kyle
killed two and injured one.

Brian Fishman, the head of Counter Terrorism and Dangerous Organizations at
Facebook, posted a thread on Twitter stating that Facebook classified the
shooting as "a mass murder" and removed Kyle Rittenhouse's accounts from both
Facebook and Instagram. Additionally, any "support" of Kyle Rittenhouse would
be censored:
> I have a brief thread on the tragic shootings in Kenosha, based on findings
> from FB’s initial internal investigation. 1/n
>
> Yesterday we designated the shooting as a mass murder and removed the
> shooter’s accounts from Facebook & Instagram. Per standard practice in these
> situations, we are also removing praise and support of the shooter and have
> also blocked searches of his name on our platforms. 2/n
