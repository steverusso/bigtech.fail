The day after Gavin and the Proud Boys disavowed "Unite the Right 2" (an alt-right rally to be held in Washington DC), Twitter banned him as well as several other accounts related to the Proud Boys.

This was a deliberate attempt by BigTech to tie Gavin and the Proud Boys to white-supremacist, alt-right movements and thereby set a false narrative.
This pattern supports Alex Jones's claim that BigTech will ban you so that you can't defend yourself when they proceed to lie about you.
