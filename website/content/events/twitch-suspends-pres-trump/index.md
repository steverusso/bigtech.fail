Twitch temporarily suspended President Trump's [campaign
account](https://archive.is/iox6D) for "hateful conduct." The platform
[cited](http://archive.is/0GIP5#selection-867.0-889.471) the following two
instances that violated their policies.

The first is the infamous excerpt from Trump's 2016 campaign rally, which was
recently rebroadcasted on his campaign's Twitch channel:
> When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not
> sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots
> of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing
> drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good
> people. But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And
> it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us
> not the right people.

The second is an excerpt from Trump's Tulsa rally which took place on June 20,
2020:
> Hey, it's 1:00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on
> occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young
> woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do.
> And you call 911 and they say, "I'm sorry, this number's no longer working."
> By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a
> young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping.
