YouTube removed [yet]() [another]() episode of the _Ron Paul Liberty Report_
for "medical misinformation." This time, it was a video partially dedicated to
questioning the motives of ~~psychopath~~ Bill Gates.

> ATTN: Ron Paul Liberty Report Viewers! @YouTube has notified us we violated
> their "community guidelines" over a recent show about Bill Gates. If our

The description of the video, which is [still available on
Odysee](https://odysee.com/@RonPaul:d/what-s-in-it-for-bill-gates-does-he-want:a),
read as follows:

> Bill Gates doesn't need the money, that is for sure. So what motivates him to
> spend billions of dollars on organizations that seek to destroy our privacy
> and run our lives? It is a big ego trip...or worse? Plus - shameful arrest
> of a mother in Idaho and Texas Governor Abbott's pitifully weak "recovery"
> plan. All in today's Liberty Report.
