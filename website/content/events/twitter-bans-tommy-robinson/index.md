Twitter permanently banned Tommy Robinson, **@TRobinsonNewEra**, who had about
400k followers, without giving a specific reason other than just citing their
hateful conduct policy.

This happened less than a month after Robinson was [temporarily
suspended](/e/twitter-suspends-tommy-robinson/) from Twitter for a week.
