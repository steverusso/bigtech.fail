Facebook and Twitter suppressed the following post
made by President Trump after his release from the hospital due to COVID-19.

> Flu season is coming up! Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and
> despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu. Are we going to close down our
> Country? No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to
> live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!

Facebook outright removed it. Twitter restricted the ability to interact with
the tweet and placed a label on it that began with "This Tweet violated the
Twitter Rules about spreading misleading and potentially harmful information
related to COVID-19."

As Reclaim The Net
[noted](https://reclaimthenet.org/facebook-and-twitter-censor-trump-comparing-covid-19-to-flu/),
Trump had made a very similar tweet months prior in March of 2020 that was
**not** suppressed or labeled at all:

> So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between
> 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on.
> At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths.
> Think about that!
