Twitter suspended actress Rose McGowan after she posted a realistic looking
image of Bill Clinton getting a massage while naked:

> Bill is making the rounds again! #RoseMcGowan slammed Twitter for booting her
> over my #Clinton photo - she said she was suspended for the post because it
> included “privately produced/distributed intimate media of someone without
> their express consent.”
