Two Facebook sources told Reuters that the company agreed to start censoring anti-state content in Vietnam after facing pressure from the government.
The pressure came when state-owned telecommunications companies took Facebook's regional servers offline for about seven weeks.
During that period, the platform was barely usuable, if at all.

Facebook gave [the following statement to Reuters](https://archive.vn/fwUxl#selection-599.0-603.150):
> We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right, and work hard
> to protect and defend this important civil liberty around the world ...
>
> However, we have taken this action to ensure our services remain available
> and usable for millions of people in Vietnam, who rely on them every day.
