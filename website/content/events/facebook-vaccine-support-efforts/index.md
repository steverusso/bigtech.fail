Facebook [announced](https://archive.is/4E3D7#selection-1897.0-1897.135) their
support for public health vaccination efforts which included encouraging people
to get a flu vaccine and removing ads with "misinformation that could harm
public health efforts":

> Today, we’re launching a new global policy that prohibits ads discouraging
> people from getting vaccinated. We don’t want these ads on our platform.
>
> Our goal is to help messages about the safety and efficacy of vaccines reach
> a broad group of people, while prohibiting ads with misinformation that could
> harm public health efforts. [...] Now, if an ad explicitly discourages
> someone from getting a vaccine, we’ll reject it.

Facebook did however
[clarify](https://archive.is/4E3D7#selection-1897.0-1897.135) that ads for or
against legislation would still be allowed. They're only interested in
restricting discourse on the very thing being legislated:

> Ads that advocate for or against legislation or government policies around
> vaccines – including a COVID-19 vaccine – are still allowed.
