Twitter released [an update](https://archive.is/t44pw) four days after they
[banned President Trump](/e/twitter-bans-trump/) which mentioned how
**more than 70,000 accounts** [that
were](https://archive.is/LC22Z#selection-619.317-619.381) "were engaged in
sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale" had been removed.

However, many prominent right wing accounts lost far more than just 70,000
followers. The _New York Post_ analyzed the accounts of _politicians_ and
published [an article](https://archive.is/t44pw) that detailed how some
Republican Senators lost tens or even hundreds of thousands of followers while
some Democrat Senators gained about as much.

Below are some more accounts (linked to archived SocialBlade stats) of
individuals on the right who are not Senators who experienced a similar or
worse follower loss over the course of Jan 9 - Jan 13. These larger numbers
might possibly indicate that many users are deleting their accounts and leaving
Twitter.
