[Dave Cullen](/profiles/dave-cullen/), a political content creator,
[announced](https://www.bitchute.com/video/3nOigXR9fPk/) that he would be
prioritizing other platforms over YouTube with his content and would only be
using YouTube to notify his audience of this fact.

> So as you can see, YouTube is just impossible. I'm hanging on here by a
> thread, and it won't be long before they stick the final boot in and remove
> me completely. So, for now on, I'm going to have to move to BitChute, Odysee,
> and Minds as the primary platforms. I will of course let you know from time
> to time where to find my latest content.

Shortly before that in the video, Cullen mentions ten of his videos that had
been removed within the past year, which are listed (and linked) below:

Cullen ends on a very sombering note regarding COVID and tech censorship:

> Again, it's all about the new abnormal. Life was never supposed to go back to
> the way it was before because, if you understand the kind of digital prison
> world that the global elites like Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the World
> Economic Forum and the UN want to create for humanity, then you know that
> freedom is supposed to become a thing of the past. Unless of course people
> wake up to the this fact very soon.
