[YouTube](/youtube/) banned _The Dollar Vigilante_, a financial newsletter and
political commentary channel, after they were issued a third strike within a 90
day period. The third strike was for violating YouTube's "medical
misinformation policy." The channel had over **304k subscribers** and more than
**37.1 million total views** across about 1000 videos.

In [a video](https://www.bitchute.com/video/Km7OM3Xw0OFL/) released shortly
after being banned, Jeff Berwick mentioned how good it feels not to self censor
and the benefit of having an audience on alternative sites:

> You know what? It feels great. Because for all year, I had to self censor
> just to stay on f**king YouTube, and now I don't. I don't have to at all. So,
> it actually feels very freeing. And luckily, we've got already very large
> audiences on other sites.

Several media outlets mistakenly thought _The Dollar Vigilante_ had been banned
about two months prior, on October 15th, but this was just the result of the
channel opting to unlist its videos due to the risk of being banned from a
third strike. Berwick was [banned from Twitter](https://archive.is/p96az) about
five days later.
