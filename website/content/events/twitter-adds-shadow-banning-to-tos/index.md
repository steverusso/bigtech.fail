Twitter added language to their Terms of Service that allows them to "limit distribution or
visibility of any Content..." (in other words: shadow ban). This was noticed
about a month prior when Twitter released the new ToS that would come into
effect on January 1, 2020. The [full
sentence](http://archive.is/7AmDl#selection-963.330-963.541) reads:
> We may also remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, limit
> distribution or visibility of any Content on the service, suspend or
> terminate users, and reclaim usernames without liability to you.

It was suspected that Twitter was doing exactly this as early as February of
2016 when [Breitbart receieved
reports](/events/sources-confirm-twitter-shadow-banning-exclusively-to-breitbart/)
from two different sources. Two years after that in January of 2018, Project
Veritas [released an undercover
report](/events/project-veritas-publishes-report-on-undercover-operations-regarding-twitter/)
on Twitter which revealed even more about the shadow banning practices.
