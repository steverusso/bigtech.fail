YouTube [totally demonetized](demonetization-notice.jpg) _America First with
Nicholas J Fuentes_, as well as suspended the channel's livestreaming
capabilities for one week. The platform also [removed](video-removal.jpg) a
video titled "Omar and Tlaib BANNED from Israel | America First Ep. 441"
because it violated their "hate speech policy" (still viewable [on
altCensored](https://altcensored.com/watch?v=NLXw3KrjZ6M)).

Following this action, Nick tweeted:
> It’s the beginning of the end for me on youtube... I just got my first
> channel strike. I’m banned from streaming for one full week.

Unfortunately, he was right because he was [permanently
banned](/events/youtube-bans-nick-fuentes/) from YouTube about a month later.
