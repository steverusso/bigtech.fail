After outright blocking any link to BitChute, Twitter scaled back to just
showing users a warning page before they follow the BitChute link.
> It appears as if Twitter has started blocking all Tweets that contain

The full message on that page, which heavily discourages users from following
the link, starts with:
> The link you are trying to access has been identified by Twitter or out
> partners as being potentially spammy or unsafe, in accordance with Twitter's
> URL Policy.

BitChute reached 75% of it's on-going monthly funding goal
[less than a week prior](/events/bitchute-reaches-75p-of-funding-goal/).
