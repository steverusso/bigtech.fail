Facebook placed additional restrictions on the free flow of information in
regards to the election. This began with a spokesperson telling Forbes that
Facebook would be restricting content that their "systems predict may be
misinformation." Breitbart
[reported](https://archive.is/XvBlV#selection-585.0-589.289):

> The spokesperson told Forbes that Facebook would be taking a number of
> actions including “demotions for content on Facebook and Instagram that our
> systems predict may be misinformation, including debunked claims about
> voting” and “limiting the distribution of Live videos that may relate to the
> election on Facebook.”

Addtionally, the New York Times reported hearing from two anonymous sources
that Facebook would be adding "more friction" to all election related
conversation. Reclaim The Net
[reported](https://reclaimthenet.org/facebook-to-add-more-friction-to-the-election-fraud-conversation/):

> This means that more clicks will be required to navigate such content –
> likely with the goal of discouraging users from sharing posts. The insertion
> of extra clicks is referred to as adding more friction – and sounds like the
> exact opposite of good user experience.
