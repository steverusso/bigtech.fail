[Facebook](/facebook/) announced the expansion of their efforts to "limit
misinformation about COVID-19" to include, among other things, removing content
that claims the virus is "manufactured":

> Today, we are expanding our efforts to remove false claims on Facebook and
> Instagram about COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines and vaccines in general during
> the pandemic. [...] Today, following consultations with leading health
> organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), we are
> expanding the list of false claims we will remove to include additional
> debunked claims about the coronavirus and vaccines. This includes claims such
> as: 
>
> * COVID-19 is man-made or manufactured
> * Vaccines are not effective at preventing the disease they are meant to
>   protect against
> * Itâ€™s safer to get the disease than to get the vaccine
> * Vaccines are toxic, dangerous or cause autism

This came right around the time that the super transparent and totally not
corrupt [investigative team from the WHO](https://archive.is/z1vPU) started to
report that [the virus likely came from an animal](https://archive.is/j60JM) vs
leaking from the lab in Wuhan.
