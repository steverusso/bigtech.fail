Two days after Media Matters published [an article](https://archive.is/fSkGj)
criticizing [Patreon](/patreon/) for not banning QAnon related accounts,
Patreon announced [in a blog
post](https://archive.is/LAzfQ#selection-365.0-365.571) that they would be
removing accounts that spread "QAnon disinformation":

> While Patreon does not propagate this content directly, there are a small
> number of creators on the platform who have supported the QAnon conspiracy
> theory with their work. Because of this, and the fact that we have seen a
> number of other online platforms become overrun with pages and groups
> actively focused around QAnon disinformation, we are taking action. In an
> effort to assess and combat this growing threat, Patreon’s Policy and Trust &
> Safety teams have individually identified the creator accounts that have
> engaged in spreading QAnon-supporting disinformation.

Below are just a few of the higher profile accounts we were able to identify as
part of this purge, listed by patron count:
