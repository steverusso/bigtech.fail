Twitch and Snapchat disabled President Trump's accounts one day after [Facebook

spokesperson for Snapchat confirmed that the corporation locked President
Trump's account. A spokesperson for Twitch gave the following statement:

> In light of yesterday’s shocking attack on the Capitol, we have disabled
> President Trump’s Twitch channel. Given the current extraordinary
> circumstances and the President’s incendiary rhetoric, we believe this is a
> necessary step to protect our community and prevent Twitch from being used to
> incite further violence.
