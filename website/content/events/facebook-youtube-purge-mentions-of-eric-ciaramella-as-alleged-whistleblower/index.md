On October 30, 2019, [RealClearInvestigations published the name of the alleged "whistleblower"](https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2019/10/30/whistleblower_exposed_close_to_biden_brennan_dnc_oppo_researcher_120996.html), the person who essentially set off the process to impeachment President Trump.
The name: Eric Ciaramella.
Later on the same day, this information was picked up and referenced by news outlets such as [Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/30/realclear-investigations-suggests-whistleblower-likely-33-year-old-cia-analyst-eric-ciaramella/) and [The Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2019/10/30/anti-trump-whistleblower-worked-with-dnc-operative-who-sought-dirt-on-trump-from-ukrainian-officials/).

Less than one week later, on November 6, Donald Trump Jr. [tweeted](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1192078857031036931) the name of the whistleblower with a link to the Breitbart article.
This triggered the mainstream quite a bit.

Two days later on Friday, November 8, Facebook and YouTube issued statements saying they would remove any content that mentioned the whistleblower's name (this [according to CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/tech/facebook-whistleblower-name/index.html)).
From Facebook's statement:
> Any mention of the potential whistleblower’s name violates our coordinating harm policy, which prohibits content "outing of witness, informant, or activist."
> We are removing any and all mentions of the potential whistleblower’s name and will revisit this decision should their name be widely published in the media or used by public figures in debate.

Individuals / organizations that had content censored, in some way, include:
[Breitbart](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/business/facebook-breitbart-whistleblower.html),
[Matt Christiansen (MLC)](https://twitter.com/MLChristiansen/status/1192957496618409984),
[Tim Pool](https://www.bitchute.com/video/W6oGxCK7R3Y/),
and [Anthony Brian Logan (ABL)](https://twitter.com/ANTHONYBLOGAN/status/1192968432024731648).
