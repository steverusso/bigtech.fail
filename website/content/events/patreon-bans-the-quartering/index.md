Patreon banned Jeremy from The Quartering, claiming that he "doxed" members of the Magic The Gathering community.
In reality, he just tweeted publicly available information, and local authorities confirmed that he did nothing wrong.

This was shortly after he was banned from Magic The Gathering for "harrassment," the controversy that later became known as _#MagicGate_.
