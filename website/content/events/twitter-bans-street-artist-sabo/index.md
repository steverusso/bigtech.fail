Twitter banned Sabo, aka. @UnsavoryAgents, who had about 32k followers, without giving a reason or explanation.
He frequently targeted establishment figures such as Hillary Clinton and Kim Jong.

Shortly prior to this Twitter ban, one of his targets was [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/04/03/zuckschumer-street-artist-sabo-plasters-new-york-anti-facebook-chuck-schumer-posters/).

Thankfully Sabo's work can still be viewed on [unsavoryagents.com](https://unsavoryagents.com/).
