Stefan Molyneux, host of Freedomain, released a video regarding recent strikes
and restrictions against his YouTube channel. In [the
video](https://www.bitchute.com/video/DUpBbS8tfSkb/), he states:
> Apparently, I had "violated community standards" by publishing a short video
> last year entitled "The Death of White Males," which discussed the decline in
> life expectancy for white males, in part due to the opioid crisis. The next
> day, Wednesday, I awoke to another strike, this time for a discussion I had
> with UK journalist Katie Hopkins. Now, as I write this, two other Freedomain
> Radio videos have been set to 'Private' by YouTube and locked. One was called
> "What Pisses Me Off About the YouTube Child Sex Scandal," and the other was a
> chat I had with Tom Golden, ...

> As it stands, I am unable to publish to YouTube for two weeks.

Molyneux would be [permanently banned](/events/youtube-bans-stefan-molyneux)
