[Twitter](/twitter/) banned journalist Laura Loomer for a tweet criticizing
Ilhan Omar, a US congresswoman. The account had about 265k followers at the
time. The offending tweet was the following:

> Isn't it ironic how the twitter moment used to celebrate "women, LGBTQ, and
> minorities" is a picture if Ilhan Omar? Ilhan is pro Sharia Ilhan is pro- FGM
> Under Sharia, homosexuals are oppressed & killed. Women are abused & forced
> to wear the hijab. Ilhan is anti Jewish.

About two years later, Loomer recapped her Twitter ban in [an interview with
Michael Malice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXyFXSxXcVY) on his show _Your
Welcome_:

> I was banned from Twitter for a tweet where I said Ilhan Omar is anti-Jewish
> and pro-Sharia and pro-FGM [female genital mutilation]. I remember in 2018
> [...] I said "Michael, you have to have me on your show. There's this woman
> in Minneapolis who married her brother!" and you said "Come on Laura that
> sounds absurd." [...] I was trying to warn people about this woman who nobody
> knew about, and I said she is going to win. [...] And then I was labeled as
> anti-Muslim because I was ahead of the curve. I was punished for being a good
> investigative journalist.
