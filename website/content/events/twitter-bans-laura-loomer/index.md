Twitter banned journalist Laura Loomer for a tweet criticizing Ilhan Omar, an elected US congresswoman.

Loomer had about 265k followers at the time.
The offending tweet was:

> Isn't it ironic how the twitter moment used to celebrate "women, LGBTQ, and minorities" is a picture if Ilhan Omar?
> Ilhan is pro Sharia Ilhan is pro- FGM Under Sharia, homosexuals are oppressed & killed.
> Women are abused & forced to wear the hijab. Ilhan is anti Jewish.
