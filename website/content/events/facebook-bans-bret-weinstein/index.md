Facebook banned Bret Weinstein suddenly and without reason. The
[notice](notice.jpg) he received said that Facebook had **"already reviewed this
decision and it can't be reversed."**

> I have been evicted from Facebook. No explanation. No appeal. I have
> downloaded "my information" and see nothing that explains it. 
>
> We are governed now in private, by entities that make their own rules and are
> answerable to no process. Disaster is inevitable. We are living it.

A few hours later, a Facebook employee (and former Democratic operative)
announced on Twitter that Facebook had made a mistake and would reverse their
previously irreversible decision:

> Your account was mistakenly flagged by our system for identifying impostor
> accounts. We've restored it and are sorry for the mistake.
