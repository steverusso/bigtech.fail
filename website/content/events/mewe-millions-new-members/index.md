Amid the fallout from the [US captiol riot](/t/us-capitol-riot/), Facebook
alternative [MeWe](/alt/mewe/) experienced record growth just like other
alternative platforms and services. MeWe added 2.5 million new members in the
week prior and trended as the #2 (and briefly as the #1) social network app in
the Google Play Store:

> #MeWe is the #2 downloaded social app in the Google Play Store!
>
> And the only social network on the list that treats its members as customers
> to serve - not data to share, target, or sell. ðŸ˜ƒ :thumbs_up:
