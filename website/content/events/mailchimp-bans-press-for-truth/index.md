Mailchimp banned _Press For Truth_, an independent media outlet run by Dan
Dicks, claiming he "violated our Terms of Use" without being more specific. In
[a video](https://www.bitchute.com/video/IqpNqcXEjidX/) he made regarding this
account termination, Dan Dicks said the following:

> I was using it as a hedge against the coming censorship, and they just pulled
> the plug on me there... There is clearly a cooridinated effort here, coming
> from multiple angles, to silence me.
