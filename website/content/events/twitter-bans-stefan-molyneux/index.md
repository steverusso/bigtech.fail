Twitter banned Stefan Molyneux (@StefanMolyneux) without warning just over a
week after he was [permanently banned](/e/youtube-bans-stefan-molyneux/)
from YouTube. His **9 year old account** had **483k followers** and **42.5k
tweets**.

A Twitter spokesperson told CNN activist Oliver Darcey that Molyneux was banned
for "operating fake accounts", which is a violation of their policy against
"spam and platform manipulation."
