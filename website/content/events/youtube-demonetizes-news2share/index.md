YouTube demonetized independent media outlet _News2Share_ as part of a larger
mass demonetization and purge known as the [Vox
Adpocalypse](/vox-adpocalypse/).
> Within minutes of @YouTube's announcement of a new purge it appears they
> caught my outlet, which documents activism and extremism, in the crossfire.
>
> I was just notified my entire channel has been demonetized. I am a journalist
> whose work there is used in dozens of documentaries.

News2Share wasn't eligible for monetization again for over six months, [at
which point](/e/youtube-re-demonetizes-news2share/) YouTube allowed the
channel to be monetized but demonetized every single video on the channel.
