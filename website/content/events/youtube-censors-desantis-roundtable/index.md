Florida governor Ron DeSantis held a "public health" roundtable on March 18,
2021 [with](https://archive.ph/hGZZe#selection-2615.93-2615.236) Dr.Scott
Atlas, Professor Sunetra Gupta, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and Dr. Martin Kulldorff.
About three weeks later, YouTube removed the video. From the [_American
Institute for Economic
Research_](https://www.aier.org/article/youtube-censors-florida-governor-desantis-and-his-science-advisors/):

> As a retrospective on the policy, the governor held a roundtable with all
> four scientists. Lasting an hour and a half, they covered all the major
> issues. The video itself came to serve as a tutorial in the relationship
> between public policy and virus mitigation. 
>
> With no warning, no announcement, and no explanation, YouTube on April 7,
> 2021, suddenly deleted the entire video from its platform.

It's still available [on
