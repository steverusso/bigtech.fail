[YouTube](/youtube/) banned [_In Pursuit of Truth
(IPOT)_](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/Xe2ztraIRXRX/), a political
commentary channel, in an attempt to purge channels that the platform claimed
were spreading "harmful conspiracy theories." The two and a half year old
channel had nearly **243k subscribers** and over **43.4 million total views**
across 620 videos. _IPOT_ issued the following message soon after the ban:

> If you can still access any of my videos and are able to download them,
> please do.
>
> Not sure when my next video will be. I have to deal with some personal things
> first.
>
> It'll be a teeth kicker though.  Don't mistake silence for inactivity.
