YouTube removed an interview that [Dr. Scott
Atlas](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/scott-w-atlas) did with the Hoover
Institution because it contained information that contradicted the World Health
Organization. The interview took place on June 23, and Dr. Atlas became a
COVID-19 advisor to President Trump on August 10.
