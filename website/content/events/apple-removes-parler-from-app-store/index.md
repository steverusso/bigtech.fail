[Apple](/apple/) removed the Parler app (a Twitter alternative) from the App
Store the day after the app was [removed from the Google Play
Store](/events/google-removes-parler-from-play-store/). This move from Apple
came a few days after the rioting in the US capitol, and after Parler saw
record traffic due to Twitter and Facebook banning President Trump. An Apple
spokesperson gave a statement that included the following:

> Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these
> threats to peopleâ€™s safety. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until
> they resolve these issues.
