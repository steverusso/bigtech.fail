Twitter banned Sir Lefy Farr-Wright (@SupportOurLefty), a left-wing parody
account which had nearly 25k followers, for "platform manipulation or spam."
Sir Lefty Farr-Wright is still active [on
Parler](https://parler.com/profile/SupportOurLefty) and issued the following
[statement](https://archive.is/L5KCX) there:
> Well, I woke up this morning to discover that my Twitter account has been
> suspended. No reason was given except for an allegation of "platform
> manipulation and dissemination of spam", which is ridiculous as I detest
> spam, being much more of a Hard-Right Corned Beef man myself.
>
> I've appealed against Twitter's arbitrary decision, but am not terribly
> hopeful of them reversing their decision. I have no 'backup' account on
> Twitter and feel no inclination to start all over again, given that they
> would probably just ban me again. So this may well be the end of my Twitter
> career, which makes me feel very sad, as I have met some really great people
> there over the past 4 years.
>
> On a happier note, I will have much more time to post here on the Far-Right
> Parler and on the Hard-Right Gab, and to interact much more with my friends
> here. Talk about not all being lost!
>
> P.S. I would be immensely grateful if someone could pass on this message to
> my Twitter friends, so they'll know what's happened.
