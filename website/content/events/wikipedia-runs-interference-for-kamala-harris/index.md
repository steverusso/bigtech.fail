Over the prior few months, Kamala Harris's Wikipedia page saw a significant
increase in edits. This seemed to have been noticed first in May 2020 [by a
Reddit user](http://archive.is/2QVD3), but it didn't garner increased media
attention until early July 2020 when The Intercept
[reported](http://archive.is/NBVwQ#selection-595.0-595.265) on it, explaining
why this is important:
> Presidential vetting operations have entire teams of investigators, but for
> the public, when the pick is announced, the most common source for
> information about the person chosen is Wikipedia. And there, a war has broken
> out over how to talk about Harris’s career.

The edits were overwhelmingly either removing negative / damaging language or
adding positive language regarding the many shady aspects of Harris's political
career. About a week later, Breitbart
[reported](http://archive.is/2N20R#selection-669.0-677.82) that the article
from The Intercept had caused reversal efforts, but they were being slowed:
> Since the Intercept article, editors have attempted to reverse a number of
> changes Nguyen made to the article, though have so far rejected completely
> undoing his removals, arguing every change should be vetted carefully.

Kamala Harris was picked to be Joe Biden's running mate just over a month later
on August 11, 2020. It [seems](https://archive.is/XEIzV) to be a
[pattern](https://archive.is/9mSPx) that the person who is eventually chosen
for the VP slot sees their Wikipedia page heavily edited before being publicly
announced as the running mate.
