Twitter suspended the official account of _Unplanned_, a movie about the true
story of Planned Parenthood clinic director [Abby
Johnson](https://www.abbyjohnson.org/thanks-for-stopping-by) who became a
pro-life activist after she witnessed a fetus struggling for its life during
an ultrasound-guided abortion. The suspension came during the movie's opening
weekend.

> @jack why are they suspended? You’ve banned both my & @LiveAction account

> because it challenges your pro-abortion bias?

After immediate and significant backlash, Twitter reinstated the account about
an hour later and [told
Breitbart](https://archive.vn/f16kc#selection-585.0-585.290):
> It wasn't directly about this account. When an account violates the Twitter
> Rules, the system looks for linked accounts to mitigate things like ban
> evasion. In this case, on a second review, it was clear the account should
> not be affected by the other account's suspension.

However, even after the account was reinstated, [many users
noticed](https://archive.vn/dLrdZ#selection-913.2-929.49) they automatically
unfollowed the Unplanned account and were unable to manually re-follow.
> Hey @jack - why aren't you letting me follow @UnplannedMovie ? I've tried
> eight times to support my friend @AbbyJohnson and @Twitter won't let me.
> Others are having the same issue. Please correct this. Thank you.

This wasn't fixed for at least another few hours.
