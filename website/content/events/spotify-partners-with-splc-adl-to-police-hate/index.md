Spotify [announced in a blog post](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2018-05-10/spotify-announces-new-hate-content-and-hateful-conduct-public-policy/) that they would be partnering with several far-left organizations to police "hate content" and "hateful content" on their platform.
From the blog post:

> To help us identify hate content, we have partnered with rights advocacy groups, including The Southern Poverty Law Center, The Anti-Defamation League, Color Of Change, Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ), GLAAD, Muslim Advocates, and the International Network Against Cyber Hate.

Spotify posted a [clarification update](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2018-06-01/spotify-policy-update/) on these particular policies a few weeks later.
However, they remained committed to their partnerships and this concept of "hate speech."

> We’re not talking about offensive, explicit, or vulgar content – we’re talking about hate speech.
