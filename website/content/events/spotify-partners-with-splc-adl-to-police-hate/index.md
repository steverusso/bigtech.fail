Spotify [announced in a blog post](https://archive.is/T2Ws0) that they would be
partnering with several far-left organizations to police "hate content" and
"hateful content" on their platform. From the blog post:

> To help us identify hate content, we have partnered with rights advocacy
> groups, including The Southern Poverty Law Center, The Anti-Defamation
> League, Color Of Change, Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ), GLAAD, Muslim
> Advocates, and the International Network Against Cyber Hate.

Spotify posted a [clarification update](https://archive.is/hWW6r) on these
particular policies a few weeks later. However, they remained committed to
their partnerships and this concept of "hate speech."

> We’re not talking about offensive, explicit, or vulgar content – we’re
> talking about hate speech.
