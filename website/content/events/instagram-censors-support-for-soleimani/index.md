In order to comply with "US sanctions laws", Instagram started removing posts
and suspending accounts that voiced support for Qassem Soleimani, a commander
in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps who was killed by a US drone strike on
January 3rd.

From the [International Federation of Journalists](https://archive.vn/jeqyR#selection-1337.293-1337.476):
> ... - at least fifteen journalists have reported their profile being suspended.
> Some profiles have been restored, but posts containing information about
> Soleimani were deleted permanently.

A Facebook spokesperson [told The Hill](https://archive.vn/askCP#selection-1801.1-1801.258):
> We review content against our policies and our obligations to US sanctions
> laws, specifically those related to the US government's designation of the
> IRGC and its leadership as a terrorist organization

Instagram [removed Soleimani's account](https://archive.vn/13vA5) less than a
year prior after the US government designated the IRGC as a terrorist
organization.
