Twitter placed any activity related to the [QAnon](http://archive.is/EB23Q)
"conspiracy theory" under a new classification of "coordinated harmful
activity." In an attempt to purge all related content, Twitter accounced the
following policy changes:
> We've been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that
> has the potential to lead to offline harm. In line with this approach, this
> week we are taking further action on so-called 'QAnon' activity across the
> service.
>
> We will permanently suspend accounts Tweeting about these topics that we know
> are engaged in violations of our multi-account policy, coordinating abuse
> around individual victims, or are attempting to evade a previous suspension â€”
> something we've seen more of in recent weeks.
>
> In addition, we will:
>
> 1. No longer serve content and accounts associated with QAnon in Trends and
>    recommendations
> 2. Work to ensure we're not highlighting this activity in search and
>    conversations 
> 3. Block URLs associated with QAnon from being shared on Twitter

A Twitter spokesperson also told several news outlets that the platform had
already **removed about 7k accounts** over the past week and that these policy
changes were expected to **impact nearly 150k _more_ accounts** worldwide over
the following week.

Twitter is not the only platform to have taken action against QAnon. In early
May, Facebook [announced](http://archive.is/VekO6#selection-1525.0-1527.388)
they had removed 5 pages, 20 accounts, and 6 groups "associated with the QAnon
network." In late May, Google
[removed](https://reclaimthenet.org/google-qanon-apps-removed/) 3 QAnon apps
from the Play Store.
