Facebook removed a video by comedian Andrew Schulz titled **"Ghislaine &
Epstein... How DEEP Their Pedo Connections Go | Andrew Schulz"** because it
violated the platform's policies against "Bullying and Harassment." The people
he potentially "harassed", in order of appearance, are: Ghislaine Maxwell,
Jeffrey Epstein, Kevin Spacey, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, Les
Wexner, Bill Gates, and Alan Dershowitz. He "bullied" this group of elites by
simply pointing out their blatant connections to one another.

Towards the end of the video, [Schulz questions](https://youtu.be/hBaObOJ2Jbg?t=290)
why all of this information is still being dismissed as baseless:
> But with everything we know, how is anyone still calling this a baseless
> conspiracy theory? How come conspiracies are only "baseless" when they're
> questioning powerful politicians but not when it's weapons of mass
> destruction in Iraq?

Three days later, after getting over a million views on Facebook, it was
flagged and removed. Schulz tweeted a screenshot of the video's removal notice
with the following:
> Apparently Facebookâ€™s bullying policy protects convicted pedophiles and the
> people that enable them from bullying. Interesting ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
