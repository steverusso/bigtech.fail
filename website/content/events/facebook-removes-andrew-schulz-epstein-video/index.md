Facebook and Instagram removed a video by comedian Andrew Schulz titled
**"Ghislaine & Epstein... How DEEP Their Pedo Connections Go | Andrew
Schulz."** Instagram did so without warning or explanation; Facebook claimed
that it violated the platform's policies against "Bullying and Harassment."

The people he potentially "harassed", in order of appearance, are: Ghislaine
Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein, Kevin Spacey, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Prince
Andrew, Les Wexner, Bill Gates, and Alan Dershowitz. He "bullied" this group of
elites by simply pointing out their blatant connections to one another.

Towards the end of the video, [Schulz questions](https://youtu.be/hBaObOJ2Jbg?t=290)
why all of this information is still being dismissed as baseless:
> But with everything we know, how is anyone still calling this a baseless
> conspiracy theory? How come conspiracies are only "baseless" when they're
> questioning powerful politicians but not when it's weapons of mass
> destruction in Iraq?

Three days later, after getting over a million views on Facebook, it was
flagged and removed. Schulz tweeted a screenshot of the video's removal notice
with the following:
> Apparently Facebookâ€™s bullying policy protects convicted pedophiles and the
> people that enable them from bullying. Interesting ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”

For the time being, the video is still available [on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBaObOJ2Jbg), and Schulz made a [follow
up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqPjaj-UbTo) as well.
