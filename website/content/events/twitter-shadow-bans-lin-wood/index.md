Twitter was caught shadow banning Lin Wood, an attorney representing [Kyle
Rittenhouse](/context/kyle-rittenhouse/), less than a week after he was
["mistakenly" suspended](/e/twitter-suspends-lin-wood/). Reclaim The Net
[reported](https://archive.is/goYXM#selection-365.0-395.46) and confirmed that
his Twitter handle was removed from search results:

> Twitter Shadowban Test, a tool that detects various types of Twitter
> shadowbans, shows that @LLinWood’s username isn’t appearing in Twitter search
> for users who aren’t already following the account.
>
> Manual searches for both “@LLinWood” and “LLinWood” confirm the shadowban and
> return no results.
