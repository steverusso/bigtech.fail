YouTube banned Stefan Molyneux, host of Freedomain, as a part of a coordinated,
multi-platform purge involving thousands of accounts. Molyneux's 14 year old
channel, which had over **928k subscribers** and nearly **300 million lifetime
views**, was terminated without any prior warnings or strikes due to ["hate
speech."](https://archive.is/irLeN/image) YouTube did give a more specific
reason than that.

As was the case with many others in the past, Molyneux was baselessly smeared
after he had his primary platform taken away. Some articles went so far as to
label him as an advocate for eugenics despite [clearly
objecting](https://www.bitchute.com/video/J8a1ruVxVv4/) to such practices and
embracing the [non-aggression
principle](https://thenonaggressionprinciple.com/) as a fundmental doctrine.

Twitch banned Molyneux about 45 minutes into his first livestream.
