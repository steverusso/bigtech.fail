Facebook banned [Shane Trejo](https://bigleaguepolitics.com/author/shane/), a
reporter for Big League Politics, without a warning or explanation. It happened
very shortly after Facebook announced its crackdown on QAnon related accounts,
but Trejo _is not_ a QAnon supporter and had actually been critical of the
movement. According to [National File](http://archive.is/t6SPO#selection-1727.0-1731.221):
> Trejo, however, was not a member of a militia group, and had previously
> criticized QAnon on social media. However, he did recently publish an article
> that was critical of outgoing Rep. Denver Riggleman (R-VA) for heaping praise
> on a rant by CNNâ€™s Jake Tapper against the QAnon movement. Even in that
> article, however, there was no expression of support for QAnon itself.
