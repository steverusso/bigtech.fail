On June 27th, after the second round of the first Democratic primary debate, Tulsi Gabbard was the most searched for candidate (according to several reports).
It was at this same time that Gabbard's campaign ads on Google were censored.

In other words, right at the moment when Americans wanted to know more about Tulsi Gabbard, Google suspended her ad campaign.

Quoting from [the Breibart article](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/07/25/tulsi-gabbard-sues-google-for-censorship-of-ads/):

> Gabbard's complaint accuses Google of censoring the candidate at the very moment when millions of Americans wanted to learn more about her. It also accuses Google of sending Gabbard's campaign emails to people's Gmail spam folders at a "disproportionately high rate."

Gabbard filed a lawsuit against Google a month later on July 25th.
