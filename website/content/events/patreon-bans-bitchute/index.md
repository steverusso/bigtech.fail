About two weeks after being [banned from Paypal](https://bitchute.info/bitchutes-immediate-removal-from-paypal/), BitChute was banned from Patreon as well.

Regarding the reason for being banned, BitChute CEO Ray Vahey said in [the article](https://bitchute.info/bitchute-suspended-by-patreon-but-theres-more/):
> ...the most serious claim is that Patreon believes that BitChute has no policies against violent organizations.
> This is 100% not true, we are completely against violence, incitement to violence, violent organizations, child abuse, and terrorism.

Their appeal was [denied one week later](https://bitchute.info/patreon-part-two-our-appeal-was-denied/).
> We wonâ€™t be getting our Patreon account back after all. The entire situation from start to finish was odd, even the reason we were suspended changed from email to email. In the end, I got the feeling they just wanted us gone.
