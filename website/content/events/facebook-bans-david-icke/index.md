Just two days before Rose/Icke III was scheduled to air, Facebook banned David Icke.

Additionally, this came just three days after Facebook [completely suspended London Real's advertising capabilities](/events/facebook-suspends-london-real-ad-capabilities/) (likely a consequence of airing [Rose/Icke II](/events/youtube-removes-rose-icke-ii/)).

The ban notice on Icke's Facebook page contained the following:
> Your Page has been unpublished for going against the Facebook Community Standards on health misinformation that could cause physical harm.

Less than a month prior, both David Icke and London Real had [content scrubbed by several major platforms](/events/london-real-and-david-icke-have-content-removed-from-several-major-platforms/), including Facebook.
