In a blog post, Twitter laid out the blueprints for how the platform plans to
stifle its political opposition under the guise of protection and safety. The
article states how Twitter will approach situations with world leaders and what
the different types of enforcement scenarios might look like.

The article is also supposedly to serve [as Twitter's
statement](http://archive.is/FNXCZ#selection-903.0-903.240) going forward so
the platform doesn't have to explain each ~~ridiculous~~ enforcement decision:
> This post seeks to provide clear insight into how we address content from
> world leaders on Twitter today, and will serve as our statement on the
> decisions we make, rather than our teams providing feedback on individual
> Tweets and decisions.

The article [closes with](http://archive.is/FNXCZ#selection-915.0-915.262):
> Our goal is to enforce our rules judiciously and impartially. In doing so, we
> aim to provide direct insight into our enforcement decision-making, to serve
> public conversation, and protect the publicâ€™s right to hear from their
> leaders and to hold them to account.
