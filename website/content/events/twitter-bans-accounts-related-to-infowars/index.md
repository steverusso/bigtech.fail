Twitter confirmed to CNN activist Oliver Darcy that they had in fact removed 18 accounts that were related to InfoWars or Alex Jones in any way whatsoever.

Twitter said they consider these accounts to be attempts by Jones and/or InfoWars to circumvent [the permanent bans from Twitter](/e/twitter-bans-alex-jones/) that happened about a month and a half prior.
