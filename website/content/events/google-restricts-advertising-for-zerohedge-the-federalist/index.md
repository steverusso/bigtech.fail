NBC, along with the Center for Countering Digital Hate, pressured Google into
taking action against ZeroHedge and the Federalist. Google ended up temporarily
restricting the two news sites' advertising capabilities due to content in
certain comment sections.

The Federalist resolved the issue by temporarily disabling their comment
sections altogether, and ZeroHedge [announced plans to implement a
filter](https://archive.vn/LlX5C) in order to get advertising capabilities back
while they work on other solutions.

Comically, after lobbying Google to hinder two of their online competitors, NBC
botched their own story. [The original article](https://archive.vn/rj36P)
claimed that Google outright banned both The Federalist and ZeroHedge from
advertising, which actually caused Google to [issue a
statement](https://archive.vn/qOjoU) to correct the record.

Commenting on the matter a few days later, Sargon of Akkad [gave a really
interesting summary](https://www.bitchute.com/video/deC253KuTV0/):
> This is the position we're in: you have a publisher [ZeroHedge / The
> Federalist] who can't act as a platform for comments, but a platform [Google]
> can act as a publisher and direct the publishers [ZeroHedge / The Federalist]
> to censor those things that they themselves [Google] are not going to become
> responsible for.

About six months later, ZeroHedge [introducded ZeroHedge
Premium](https://archive.is/zLp4n), a paid version of their site that offers no
ads and freer comment sections among many other features.
