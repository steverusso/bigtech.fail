Facebook banned _AmericanAF_, a political merchandise shop, without warning for
promoting their brand in a "misleading way." The five year old page had **over
1.6 million** followers. American Military News
[reported](https://archive.is/XdL8i#selection-853.0-853.176):

> A Facebook representative said the brand was promoting merchandise with
> “’Trump’ and ‘Keep America Great’ branding in a misleading way – namely that
> this was official Trump merchandise, affiliated with the Trump campaign.’”

Facebook apparently allowed AmericanAF to start a new page which can be found
[here](https://www.facebook.com/americanafshop) (for now). A post on that page
[reads](https://archive.is/pbTpr):

> This is the OFFICIAL American AF page. The rumors are true! Our original page
> was taken down by Facebook, unfortunately.
