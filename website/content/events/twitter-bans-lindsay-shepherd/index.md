Twitter banned Lindsay Shepherd for "misgendering" during an argument with
transwoman Jessica Yaniv, the same person that was involved around [Meghan
Murphy's banning](/e/twitter-bans-meghan-murphy/).

Shepherd summed up the situtation very well in an [interview with the National
Post](http://archive.is/RY95T#selection-1889.0-1889.340):
> Because this is a trans individual they are untouchable ... they are allowed
> to mock and taunt me about my biology, they can say whatever crude things
> they want. But when it comes to me wanting to take a shot back at that person
> and wanting to stand up for myself — or for my womanhood so to speak — I am
> permanently kicked off.

Lindsay Shepherd was unbanned about ten days later [on July 26](http://archive.is/TmzDs)
(likely to due the immense international media attention this situation received).
