Twitter banned Lindsay Shepherd for "misgendering" during an argument with transwoman Jessica Yaniv, the same person that was involved around [Meghan Murphy's banning](/events/twitter-bans-meghan-murphy/).

Shepherd summed up the situtation perfectly in an [interview with the National Post](https://nationalpost.com/news/free-speech-activist-lindsay-shepherd-on-her-twitter-ban-your-instincts-should-not-be-to-celebrate):
> Because this is a trans individual they are untouchable ... they are allowed to mock and taunt me about my biology, they can say whatever crude things they want.
> But when it comes to me wanting to take a shot back at that person and wanting to stand up for myself — or for my womanhood so to speak — I am permanently kicked off.

Lindsay Shepherd was unbanned ten days later, on July 26, likely to due the immense international media attention this situation got.
