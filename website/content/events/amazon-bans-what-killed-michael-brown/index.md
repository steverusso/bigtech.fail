Amazon removed a documentary titled _"What Killed Michael Brown?"_ by Man of
Steele Productions after placing it under "content review" for nearly two
weeks, despite the producers [taking extra
care](https://archive.is/g8Ao9#selection-609.1-609.402) to ensure compliance
with Amazon's film specifications:
> It is now official. Amazon rejected "What Killed Michael Brown?" from
> appearing on its platform. When you see the film in all of its human
> complexity, compassion, intellectual spirit, this decision will shock you.
> See below press release for full details.

About a week later, Amazon reversed the decision and released the film:
> Great news! Amazon reached out to us today. We listened to one another.
> Amazon acknowledged the issue and promised to do better. So, we are proud to
> announce that "What Killed Michael Brown?" is now available on Amazon! 
>
> Thank you for your support.
