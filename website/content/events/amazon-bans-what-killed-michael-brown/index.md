Amazon removed a documentary titled _"What Killed Michael Brown?"_ by Man of
Steele Productions after placing it under "content review" for nearly two
weeks, despite the producers [taking extra
care](https://archive.is/g8Ao9#selection-609.1-609.402) to ensure compliance
with Amazon's film specifications:
> It is now official. Amazon rejected "What Killed Michael Brown?" from
> appearing on its platform. When you see the film in all of its human
> complexity, compassion, intellectual spirit, this decision will shock you.
> See below press release for full details.

Less than a week later, Amazon reversed the decision and released the film
without the permission of the production company, causing them to send a cease
and desist letter to Amazon:
> In a stunning reversal, Amazon platformed our film, "What Killed Michael
> Brown?" without our permission. We sent them a cease and desist letter just
> now. Truth matters. Please see our website for details.

The following brief excerpt from [the
trailer](https://youtu.be/ZIbAI1vEl-E?t=114) gives a hint as to why this film
might have annoyed "the powers that be" during a time when they rely on extreme
racial tensions in order to maintain and increase their power:
> America's original sin is not slavery. It is simply the use of race as a
> means to power.

The film is available to be purchased [digitally on
Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/whatkilledmichaelbrown) as well as
[physically on the film's
website](https://whatkilledmichaelbrown.com/buy-dvd-blu-ray).
