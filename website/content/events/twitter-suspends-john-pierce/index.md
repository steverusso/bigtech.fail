Twitter suspended John Pierce, a defense attorney representing [Kyle
Rittenhouse](/context/kyle-rittenhouse/), because he posted [the following
tweet](notice.jpg) which was deemed to be "glorifying violence":

> Kyle Rittenhouse will go down in American history alongside that brave
> unknown patriot at Lexington Green who fired "The Shot Heard Round The World"
> on April 19, 1775. A Second American Revolution against Tyranny has begun.
> #FightBack

When he was unsuspended, he noted that he was the second attorney representing
Kyle Rittenhouse to be suspended by Twitter after advocating for their client,
the first being [Lin Wood](/events/twitter-suspends-lin-wood/) a couple of days
prior:

> I am back from the Twitter penalty box. Twitter has now censored TWO of Kyle
> Rittenhouse’s lawyers, myself and @LLinWood. I would like to thank Jack
> Dorsey for handing us yet another lawsuit. #FightBack #fearless #FreeKyle
> #redemption
