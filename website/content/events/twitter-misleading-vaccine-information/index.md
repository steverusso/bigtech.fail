Twitter announced in a blog post that they would be removing
tweets that contain "harmful false or misleading information" about COVID-19
vaccines and labeling tweets that "advance unsubstantiated rumors." [From the
announcement](https://archive.is/wnYXB#selection-763.0-803.166):

> Moving forward and beginning next week, we are expanding the policy and may
> require people to remove Tweets which advance harmful false or misleading
> narratives about COVID-19 vaccinations, including: 
>
> * False claims that suggest immunizations and vaccines are used to
>   intentionally cause harm to or control populations, including statements
>   about vaccines that invoke a deliberate conspiracy;
> * False claims which have been widely debunked about the adverse impacts or
>   effects of receiving vaccinations; or
> * False claims that COVID-19 is not real or not serious, and therefore that
>   vaccinations are unnecessary.
>
> Starting in early 2021, we may label or place a warning on Tweets that
> advance unsubstantiated rumors, disputed claims, as well as incomplete or
> out-of-context information about vaccines.
