Later, on July 2nd, [Cochran joined Project Veritas](https://www.projectveritas.com/2019/07/02/pinterest-insider-joins-project-veritas/), saying:
> I’ve decided to work with Project Veritas because I want to continue to make a positive impact in our country and culture.
> Insiders will play a major role in exposing the injustices of our world and they’ll help hold the most powerful Big Tech and other organizations accountable for their actions.
> I am looking forward to emboldening more insiders to speak the truth.
