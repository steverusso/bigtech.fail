Twitter heavily restricted the account of Julian Assange's mother, Christine
Assange, without warning or explanation. Ms. Assange [told Consortium
News](https://archive.vn/nOkSC#selection-295.0-295.163) that her account was
restricted for "unusual activity." It was unrestricted a short while later.

Ms. Assange used this account primarily to help in her campaign to free her
son, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. In the two weeks leading up to her
account being restricted, Ms. Assange had been replying to tweets by Hillary
Clinton and John Bolton, two very shady government figures.

Julian Assange [was arrested](https://archive.vn/9bTuW) about three weeks after
this happened. A major Twitter account centered around organizing support for
Assange [was suspended](/e/twitter-suspends-julian-assange-defense-account/)
several months after his arrest, only to be reinstated following enough public
outcry.

As [Project Veritas revealed](/e/project-veritas-publishes-report-on-undercover-operations-regarding-twitter/)
in the beginning of 2018, Twitter is sometimes pressured by the government to
take certain actions.
