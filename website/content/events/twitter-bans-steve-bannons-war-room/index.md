[Twitter](/twitter/) permanently banned _Steve Bannon's War Room_ after he made
the following comments during one of the War Room's podcasts:

> Second term kicks off with firing Wray, firing Fauci. Nah, actually I wanna
> go a step farther, but I realize the President is a kind hearted man and a
> good man. I'd actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England. I'd
> put the heads on pikes. Right? I'd put them at the two corners of the White
> House, as a warning to federal bureaucrats. You either get with the program,
> or you're gone. Time to stop playing games. Blow it all up. Put Rick Grenell,
> today, as the interim head of the FBI. That'll light 'em up, right?

Bannon's War Room account was temporarily suspended [a few days prior on
election night](/e/twitter-suspends-steve-bannons-war-room/) as well as
[seven months prior](https://reclaimthenet.org/twitter-suspends-war-room-pandemic/)
in April, both (as far as can be discerned) for no specific reason.
