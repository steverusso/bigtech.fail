A few months after the first [_White Coat Summit_](/e/white-coat-summit/) was
heavily censored, YouTube censored the second _White Coat Summit_ a few days
after it took place and was uploaded for "spam, deceptive practices, and
scams":

> WOW: YouTube has removed our White Coat Summit video from its platform under
> fraudulent and manufactured pretenses, labeling it as “spam, deceptive
> practices, & scams.”
>
> @YouTube is now openly censoring licensed medical professionals.

Two days later, Vimeo deleted the entire account for _America's Frontline
Doctors_, the organization that, among other things, coordinated these press
conferences:

> .@Vimeo has just deleted our entire account and removed all of the videos
> from our Physicians conference.
>
> Vimeo is now openly censoring licensed medical professionals.
