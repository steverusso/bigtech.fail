Twitter temporarily suspended Hogan Gidley, the national press secretary for
the Trump campaign, for violating Twitter's rules against "posting misleading
information about voting" after he
[tweeted](https://archive.is/KCEP6#selection-1263.1-1263.239) the following:

> Got ‘my’...uh wait...no…”Daniel’s” ballot in the mail?!? Who is that?
> Apparently it’s a former tenant who hasn’t lived in the unit for 8 YEARS!!!
> But yeah, sure...the mainstream media is correct...unsolicited vote-by-mail
> is ‘totally safe.'

This happened just hours before the final presidental debate and about two
weeks before the election.

> I, like many other Americans, received a ballot in the mail that was not
> meant for me. Twitter suspended my account for simply posting about it. 
>
> This censorship is insanity. 
>
> We must continue to expose and fight Big Tech’s clear bias against
> conservatives who speak the truth.
