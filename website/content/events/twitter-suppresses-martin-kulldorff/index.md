Twitter suppressed the following tweet from Martin Kulldorff, a professor at
Harvard Medical School and one of the co-creators of the Great Barrington
Declaration. Twitter prevented anyone from liking, retweeting, or replying to
it in addition to placing a label on it that read: "This Tweet is misleading.
Learn why health officials recommend a vaccine for most people."

> No. Thinking that everyone must be vaccinated is as scientifically flawed as
> thinking that nobody should. COVID vaccines are important for older high-risk
> people, and their care-takers. Those with prior natural infection do not need
> it. Nor children.

He addressed this in a follow-up tweet when it happened a couple of weeks
later:

> When making unscientific claims, media often refer to "health officials" or
> "experts" without citing anyone. I challenge @Twitter to name vaccine experts
> believing that everyone, including children and those with prior immunity
> from natural infection, MUST be Covid vaccinated.
