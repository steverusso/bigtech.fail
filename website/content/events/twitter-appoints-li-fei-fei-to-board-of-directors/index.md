Twitter appointed Li Fei-Fei, former Vice President of Google, to its Board of Directors as an "independent director."

For anyone wondering why this is such a controversial event, Twitter certainly doesn't help by describing her career at Google with one short sentence:
"From January 2017 to September 2018, Dr. Li was Vice President at Google and served as Chief Scientist of AI/ML at Google Cloud."
Thankfully, Taiwan News is here to help [fill in the gaps](https://archive.vn/HvJRm#selection-737.169-749.240):
> Li quit Google in 2018 after a trail of leaked internal emails revealed that
> she appeared to be more concerned about the public relations damage to
> Google's image if news broke about the company's work on Project Maven than
> the ethical issues raised by over 3,000 Google employees.
>
> Project Maven is a U.S. Department of Defense AI project that seeks to use
> the technology to help military drones select targets from video footage.
>
> During her tenure at Google, there is no public record of Li objecting to the
> controversial Project Dragonfly, which was meant to be a search engine that
> would suit China's censorship rules, as she opened an AI research facility in
> Beijing.

So to sum up, during her time as Vice President of Google, the company:
1. helped the _US drone_ more efficiently (Project Maven).
2. helped _China censor_ more efficiently (Project Dragonfly).
3. opened an AI research facility in Beijing, the surveillance capital of the world.

Furthermore, [Radio Free Asia highlights](https://archive.vn/3Lb0L#selection-543.0-551.306) additional shady areas in Li's background:
> Li has been linked to a students' association under the aegis of the Chinese
> Communist Party's United Front Work Department.

> Li also has ties to the Beijing-based Future Forum ... The organization
> operates under the aegis of the state-run China Association for Science and
> Technology, and is supported by Beijing's Chaoyang District Government ...

Taiwan News also reported that after just a week of Li being hired, several Chinese dissident accounts [were suspended without notice](https://archive.vn/HvJRm#selection-797.0-813.317) or for vague reasons.
Coincidentally, most of these accounts had posted something critical of Li Fei-Fei shortly before being shutdown.
