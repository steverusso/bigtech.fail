YouTube "terminated" the channel of Gavin McInnes "due to repeated claims of
copyright infringement."

Several days later, Gavin's channel was fully reinstated. McInnes [told
TheWrap](http://archive.is/HQxqb#selection-597.1-597.252):
> It was really unusual. Some of the videos had nothing to do with copyright
> claims but were listed as such. I contacted Vans and they said they told
> YouTube to drop the charges and now I'm back. It won't last.

It lasted about a year and half until he was [permanently
banned](/events/youtube-bans-gavin-mcinnes/) on June 22, 2020 for no specific
reason.
