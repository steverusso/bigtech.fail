[Facebook](/facebook/) took drastic action against Dan Smotz, host of [_The
System Is Down_](/profiles/tsid/) podcast. After publishing an episode of the
podcast titled _204: Is Cue A-non Dead? Is Epstein Alive? Where's The Kraken?
#TrustThePlan? w. Scott McElroy_, Facebook banned Smotz's personal account and
any pages on which he was an admin **as well as** his wife's personal account
and any pages on which _she_ was an admin. Speaking with BigTech.fail, Smotz
confirmed that Facebook did all of this **without contacting him once**,
meaning **no warning, no explanation, and no possibilty for appeal**.

>  As many of you know, my podcast page The System is Down, got banned from
>  Facebook this week... But it wasn’t just the podcast... It was my personal
>  page, my forums, my many business pages, my music pages, and 10 YEARS of
>  work that I poured into a platform that doesn’t respect any of us enough to
>  even give us an explanation when they’re done with us, or even let us file
>  any kind of appeal...
>
>  Oh but that’s not all. They also banned MY WIFE’S personal account (which
>  she needs in order to do her job) along with her business page as well,
>  seemingly just because she was an admin on my page.

Therefore, Smotz and his wife had to infer from [recent
events](/t/us-capitol-riot/) and news articles that they were banned due to the
discussion of QAnon despite **Smotz not subscribing to this theory himself and
largely pushing back against it in the episode**. Ironically, in the opening of
that episode, Smotz [explained](https://youtu.be/f1shf3h9474?t=468) the
importance of exploring different avenues of thought and thinking for
ourselves:

> I think it's important to have these conversations that are deemed
> inappropriate [...]. What if, just hypothetically, what if the people who are
> shutting down all these crazy conspiracy theorists, what if there's a little
> bit more behind it? What if the people who are saying that you're not allowed
> to dig into one topic, maybe there's more of a reason than "it's false." If
> you think that exploring different avenues of thought [...] [is] dangerous,
> then that's just because you don't know how to think for yourself.

In a statement, Smotz pointed out that these technology corporations are
essentially functioning as new branches of government, and that this is not so
much about a particular set of political beliefs, but rather "if you question
the power." His full statement can be read below:

> First they came for Alex Jones and I said nothing... for I was not Alex
> Jones...
>
> I think there's something wholly unifying in being able to have civil
> uncomfortable conversations on taboo topics. That's what I do on my show. I
> talk to people I disagree with and seek truth, regardless of how inconvenient
> it may be.  In the last year, I've been called a "left wing commie", for
> trying hard to understand certain points of view. I've been called
> "alt-right" for questioning the narrative of liars in the media.  I am
> neither of these things... I am a libertarian and as a libertarian, I believe
> every individual has value, even if they have bad ideas.
>
> This social media censorship fad, that my wife and I got hit with and
> continue to fight, isn't a simple case of property rights. It is more akin to
> "book burning" than "cake baking" and more-so, it's unlike anything at all
> that we've ever witnessed before. We're talking about thought crimes, guilt
> by association, and removal from what have become the largest communication
> devices in known human history, without warning and without explanation.
> We're talking about haphazard contract agreements with the technology
> industrial complex, where the rules can be altered at will without notice (by
> only one side of the agreement) and terminated without reason. We're talking
> about the digital public square, while the literal physical public square is
> also on lock down by government edict. We're talking about 10 years of work
> and business poured into a platform that will gather and sell your
> information to the highest bidder and cast you and all of your work and
> progress out, the moment you're no longer convenient for their politically
> biased narratives. We're talking about silicon valley cronies, who have no
> medical background, deciding which doctors, scientists, and medical experts
> get to share their findings and innovations with the public. We're talking
> about corrupt individuals in power, directly limiting our ability to
> converse, unite, and advance as a species. 
>
> I'm not calling for more government intervention. I'm calling for less
> government protection. We're essentially watching new branches of government
> and propaganda destroying small businesses with impunity, for having
> different if common political leanings.
>
> While some libertarians dance on the social media graves of people they
> disagree with, people like former CIA Director, John Brenan is pushing a
> narrative for President Biden's administration, on daytime television, that
> broad brush lumps ALL libertarians in with terrorists and we continue to see
> libertarian after libertarian forcibly removed from the conversation... It's
> flagrant divide and conquer of all dissenting opinions.  Regardless of your
> political leaning, if you question the power... you're probably next. Stop
> celebrating the punishment of free thinkers, no matter how "crazy" you think
> they are. You may still have more to learn.  The only way we unite as a
> species, is by having the conversations. There are those who would prefer we
> do neither. Stop giving them power. #youarethepower
