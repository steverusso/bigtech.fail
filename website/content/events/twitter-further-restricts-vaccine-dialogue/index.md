[Twitter](/twitter) announced a new set of measures it would be implementing to
combat "COVID-19 vaccine misinformation." The first measure was labeling tweets
that Twitter deems to contain "misleading information", something the
corporation had been doing for a while regarding other topics (such as the
election). They also mention how many tweets they have removed and challenged
since they started suppressing dialogue around COVID-19:

> Starting today, we will begin applying labels to Tweets that may contain
> misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines, in addition to our continued
> efforts to remove the most harmful COVID-19 misleading information from the
> service. Since introducing our COVID-19 guidance, we have removed more than
> 8,400 Tweets and challenged 11.5 million accounts worldwide.

Additionally, Twitter [laid out a new strike
system](https://archive.is/l7tAM#selection-713.0-763.42) that would be used to
give people the "opportunity to further consider their behavior and their
impact on the public conversation":

> Through the use of the strike system, we hope to educate people on why
> certain content breaks our rules so they have the opportunity to further
> consider their behavior and their impact on the public conversation. [...]
> Repeated violations of the COVID-19 policy are enforced against on the basis
> of the number of strikes an account has accrued for violations of the policy.
>
> * One strike: no account-level action
> * Two strikes: 12-hour account lock
> * Three strikes: 12-hour account lock
> * Four strikes: 7-day account lock
> * Five or more strikes: permanent suspension
