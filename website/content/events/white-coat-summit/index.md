_Americaâ€™s Frontline Doctors_ held a press conference in D.C. which featured a
variety of doctors who shared their opinions and knowledge related to COVID-19.
Breitbart News [covered](http://archive.is/qsF1m) the event and live-streamed
it on Facebook.

After being available for eight hours and accumulating over 17 million views,
Facebook removed the video for "sharing false information" about COVID-19. A
short while later, YouTube and Twitter censored the video as well.

The attempts to suppress this information didn't end with just removing the
video itself. Twitter in particular went berserk. Within less than two days,
the platform:

1. [suspended Breitbart News](http://archive.is/3dVKn#selection-571.0-571.267) for days for "spreading misleading and potentially harmful information."
2. [suspended Donald Trump Jr.](/e/twitter-suspends-don-jr/) for 12 hours after he tweeted a link to the video.
3. [suspended PragerU](notice-prageru.jpg) along with other conservative leaders such as [Robby Starbuck](notice-robbystarbuck.jpg).

...and that's just to name a few cases for Twitter alone. YouTube removed many
reuploads and even coverage of the censorship itself, going so far as to
[remove videos that were themselves
censored](/e/youtube-removes-already-censored-mlc-video/). SquareSpace
even jumped in by [shutting down](http://archive.is/Ob07h) the
[americasfrontlinedoctors.com](http://archive.is/806An) website.

The full video of the press conference can still be viewed [on
BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/video/PZLBQoi0vD9G/),
