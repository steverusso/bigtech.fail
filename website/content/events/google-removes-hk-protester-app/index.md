Google removed 'The Revolution of Our Times' app from the Play Store.
They claimed that it violates their "sensitive events policy" which is meant to prevent people from capitalizing on tragic events.

From the [Hong Kong Free Press article](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/10/10/revolution-times-hong-kong-protester-role-playing-game-suspended-google-play-store): "'The Revolution of Our Times' is a choice-based story game where the player takes on the role of a Hong Kong protester."
80% of the funds raised from the game were pledged to the legal defense of protesters that had been arrested.
