On August 2, 2019, Laura Loomer [announced](https://archive.ph/lQBnu) she would
be running for the U.S. Congress in Florida's 21st congressional district. Even
though she was [personally banned from Twitter](/e/twitter-bans-laura-loomer/)
about eight months prior, Twitter policy would have meant that she gets a
verified campaign account because she is running for office.

However, a few days later, Twitter [told The Hill](https://archive.is/tjkY5)
and [told CNN](https://archive.is/nVvxO) that instead of verifying all
candidates, it would only be verifying candidates who win their primary races.
A Twitter spokesperson [said the following to The
Hill](https://archive.is/tjkY5#selection-1563.1-1563.374):

> While the public verification form is on hold, our teams around the world
> continue to verify select Twitter accounts, which include elected officials
> and government agencies. In the US, once candidates win their primary
> elections and/or qualify for the general election ballot for Congressional,
> Senate or Gubernatorial races we will verify their official Twitter accounts.

This didn't just impact Loomer and her campaign. Left-wingers woke up to this
policy a few months later when some of their candidates [_also_ remained
unverified](https://archive.is/V0uoG) vs their verified incumbent opponents. In
December of 2019, Twitter [announced](https://archive.ph/JYJco) it would be
making an effort to verify candidates. However, Loomer never got her personal
account back and never was able to establish a verified campaign account, even
[after winning her primary race](https://archive.ph/upFnO).
