On February 5, Jim Hoft, founder of the Gateway Pundit, published [an
article](https://archive.is/ehruB) with journalist Cassandra Fairbanks titled
_Exclusive: The TCF Center Election Fraud – Newly Discovered Video Shows Late
Night Deliveries of Tens of Thousands of Illegal Ballots 8 Hours After
Deadline_. Fairbanks tweeted a link to the article with the following text:

> Here is the video we found of a “vote mobile” van arriving at 3:30am and
> 4:30am... driving directly into the TCF Center and unloading dozens of boxes
> each trip. This was 8 hours after the ballot deadline.

[Twitter](/twitter/) almost immediately restricted that tweet (meaning no one
could like, retweet, or reply to it) as well as placed a warning on it that
read **"This claim of election fraud is disputed, and this Tweet can’t be
replied to, Retweeted, or liked due to a risk of violence."** While the article
she contributed to and tweeted the link to does reasonably suggest voter fraud,
she does not make any such claim in the tweet that Twitter restricted.

Twitter then did the same thing when journalist Tim Pool quote
tweeted Fairbanks' initial tweet with the following caption that referenced [a
recent Time Magazine article](https://archive.is/U525z) titled _The Secret
History of the Shadow Campaign That Saved the 2020 Election_:

> I don't think this even matters at this point. Time magazine just came out
> said that a cabal of elites rigged the election
>
> I'm sorry they said they didn't rig the election they "fortified" it, by
> changing the rules and laws as well as manipulating the flow of information
>
> -- Tim Pool (@Timcast) [5 Feb 2021](https://archive.is/kGrKZ)

A few hours later, Twitter suspended Fairbanks for 12 hours for no specific
reason other than "violating the Twitter Rules." Later in the day, Twitter
[banned Jim Hoft](/e/twitter-bans-gatewaypundit/) for violating their
"Civic Integrity Policy."
