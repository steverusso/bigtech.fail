The Atlantic Council is a US "think tank" based in Washington, DC. The
council's funding members make up [a laundry list](https://archive.is/82z7R) of
over 60 top multinational corporations and government-related parties,
including banks (such as **JP Morgan Chase** and **Bank of America**), oil
corporations (such as **BP America** and **ExxonMobil**), technology
corporations (such as **Amazon Web Services** and **Twitter**), military
contractors (such as **Raytheon** and **Lockheed Martin**), and many, _many_
others.

Katie Harbath, Facebook's **Global Politics and Government Outreach Director**,
announced in a blot post how Facebook and The Atlantic Council would be using
each other to [monitor particular geographic areas for misinformation and
foreign interference](https://archive.is/TAMUM#selection-1759.0-1759.325)
(which isn't a giant contradiction at all, foreignly interfering to combat
foreign interference):

> Facebook will also use the Atlantic Council’s Digital Research Unit
> Monitoring Missions during elections and other highly sensitive moments. This
> will allow us to focus on a particular geographic area — monitoring for
> misinformation and foreign interference and also working to help educate
> citizens as well as civil society.
