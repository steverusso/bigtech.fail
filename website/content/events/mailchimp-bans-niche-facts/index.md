Mailchimp banned [_NicheFacts_](https://nichefacts.com/about/), an online
resource that helps people create online businesses. Ryan Nelson, the founder,
[wrote the following](https://archive.is/zfT9q#selection-1823.0-1823.243)
regarding his account termination:

> What it boils down to is that this site, nichefacts.com, which is technically
> in the notorious 'make money online' space, had autoresponder emails that
> contained keywords that presumably triggered an automated review/suspension
> of my account.

Later in the article, Nelson [pointed
out](https://archive.is/zfT9q#selection-2453.0-2453.190) the danger of using a
platform that uses automated account termination such as Mailchimp did in this
case:

> This sort of automated termination is a real red flag- I would never have
> felt comfortable building my online business on the back of a platform that
> is so cavalier with account suspension.
