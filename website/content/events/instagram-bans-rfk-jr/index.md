[Instagram](/instagram) banned Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. for "repeatedly sharing
debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines", according to a
spokesperson. RFK, Jr. posted a statement [on
ChildrensHealthDefense.org](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/robert-kenney-jr-instagram-removal-account/),
the organization he founded, that opened with the following:

> Every statement I put on Instagram was sourced from a government database,
> from peer-reviewed publications and from carefully confirmed news stories.
> None of my posts were false. Facebook, the pharmaceutical industry and its
> captive regulators use the term ‘vaccine misinformation’ as a euphemism for
> any factual assertion that departs from official pronouncements about vaccine
> health and safety, whether true or not. This kind of censorship is
> counterproductive if our objective is a safe and effective vaccine supply.
