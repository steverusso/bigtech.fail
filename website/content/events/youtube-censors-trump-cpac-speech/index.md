On February 28, President Trump gave a speech at CPAC (the Conservative
Political Action Conference), and the Right Side Broadcasting Network (RSBN)
live streamed and published this on YouTube. In the speech, Trump
(unsurprisingly) mentioned things about the 2020 election which violated
YouTube's guidelines. RSBN knew this and let their audience members know that
they would not be editing it in order to keep it up (like [they
did](https://archive.is/rsW1H#selection-887.0-887.279) for an interview they
had with Mike Lindell):

> President Trump talked about election fraud. 
>
> That’s a big no-no on some platforms we stream to.
>
> We try to play by the rules, but we will not censor President Trump. 
>
> We’re not going to remove or edit this video.
>
> Just so we’re all clear- if it gets removed, we didn’t do it.
>
> -- Right Side Broadcasting Network (RSBN) (@RSBNetwork) [28 Feb 2021](https://archive.is/5lC74)

YouTube did ultimately take the video down a few days later from any channel
that posted it, including other major news outlets. Additionally, they
suspended RSBN for two weeks:

> NEW: RSBN has been suspended from YouTube for two weeks because of the Trump
> #CPAC2021 speech, which violated their guidelines on election misinformation.
>
> The video was approaching 4 million views. They have also removed it from
> their platform.
>
> Our new streaming platforms are on the way, but until then this is what we
> have to put up with.

The speech is still available to view [on
Rumble](https://rumble.com/ve9azh-donald-trumps-entire-2021-cpac-speech.html)
(or just by searching for it on any alternative video hosting platform).
