Twitter banned The Red Elephants, aka. @RealRedElephant, who had about 30k followers, without giving a reason or explanation (this [according to Vincent James](http://theredelephants.com/conservative-media-outlet-permanently-banned-twitter-without-reason/) of The Red Elephants).
From the article:
> When twitter permanently banned the account they did not provide any email or reason to The Red Elephants on why the account had been permanently suspended.

This permament suspension for The Red Elephants came after Twitter temporarily suspended the account a few months prior.
