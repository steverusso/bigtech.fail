[YouTube](/youtube/) demonetized _CyberDemon531_, an anarcho-communist who
hosts a show called _Above It All_. YouTube did not provide specific examples
of which content caused this.

> Youtube just demonetized my entire channel because I cover news and
> controversial subjects. Wow. 
>
> Please signal boost this, this will affect me quite a lot going forward.

In a follow up video, Andrea (CyberDemon531) correctly [pointed
out](https://youtu.be/jR6suSK912Y?t=210) how a channel being demonetized
doesn't mean that the channel's videos won't contain ads:

> YouTube is still running advertisements on my channel. The difference between
> being demonetized and being monetized is not ads running on my channel. The
> difference is they're going to continue running ads on my channel, except
> they're not going to give me a cut.
