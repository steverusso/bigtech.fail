_Reclaim The Net_ investigated and confirmed claims made by users that Reddit
was blocking links to [Rumble.com](https://rumble.com/), an alternative
video-hosting platform, in private messages on the platform. Didi Rankovic for
_Reclaim The Net_
[reported](https://reclaimthenet.org/reddit-blocks-links-to-rumble/):

> Reddit users have been reporting to Reclaim The Net that the social media
> site is censoring alternative video platform Rumble in private messages.
>
> Screenshots shared show that the platform is informing users that their
> messages containing links to Rumble are blocked by domain filters.
>
> Reclaim The Net was able to independently confirm this, also seeing that, on
> Desktop, any private messages that contained a link to a Rumble simply failed
> to turn up in the recipientâ€™s inbox.

About six months prior, [Reddit blocked](/e/reddit-blocks-bitchute-links/)
anyone from posting a link to BitChute, another alternative video-hosting
platform.
