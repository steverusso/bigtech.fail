Facebook's "Oversight Board" [decided to
uphold](https://archive.ph/S3WQq#selection-2409.1-2421.471) the [indefinite
"suspension"](/e/twitter-facebook-suspend-trump/) of then-President Donald
Trump, but said that Facebook must set a timeframe if this is in fact a
suspension or just make it a ban:

> The Board has upheld Facebook’s decision on January 7, 2021, to restrict
> then-President Donald Trump’s access to posting content on his Facebook page
> and Instagram account.
>
> However, it was not appropriate for Facebook to impose the indeterminate and
> standardless penalty of indefinite suspension. Facebook’s normal penalties
> include removing the violating content, imposing a time-bound period of
> suspension, or permanently disabling the page and account.
>
> The Board insists that Facebook review this matter to determine and justify a
> proportionate response that is consistent with the rules that are applied to
> other users of its platform. Facebook must complete its review of this matter
> within six months of the date of this decision. The Board also made policy
> recommendations for Facebook to implement in developing clear, necessary, and
> proportionate policies that promote public safety and respect freedom of
> expression.

Of course, Trump responded with a statement from his own site:

> What Facebook, Twitter, and Google have done is a total disgrace and an
> embarrassment to our Country. Free Speech has been taken away from the
> President of the United States because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid
> of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger and stronger than
> ever before. The People of our Country will not stand for it! These corrupt
> social media companies must pay a political price, and must never again be
> allowed to destroy and decimate our Electoral Process.
