Amazon blocked the publication of _Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and
Lockdowns: Part 1: Introduction and Death Counts and Estimates_ by Alex
Berenson because the book [did not comply](notice.jpg) with the company's
guidelines.

Amazon coincidentally reversed their decision shorty after Elon Musk himself
[brought attention](http://archive.is/90pBi) to the situation. Two days later,
the book [hit #1](http://archive.is/aDANi) on the Amazon Kindle charts.
