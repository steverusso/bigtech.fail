Twitter suspended NewsBusters reporter [Nicholas
Fondacaro](https://www.newsbusters.org/author/nicholas-fondacaro) for the
following tweet:
> Fresh from his drunken #CNNNYE bender, @CNN's @donlemon salivates for Nancy
> Pelosi becoming speaker
>
> -- Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) [3 Jan 2019](http://archive.vn/ouWVW)

In the suspension notice, [Twitter claimed](http://archive.vn/C7qsh#selection-1023.0-1025.220) that this
post "promoted violence against, threatened, or harassed other people on the
basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender
identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease."

He was reinstated about 15 hours later, and Twitter
[said](http://archive.vn/C7qsh#selection-995.150-995.186) "it looks like we
have made an error."
