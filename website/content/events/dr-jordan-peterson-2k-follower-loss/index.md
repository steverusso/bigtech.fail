Less than two weeks later, content creators have started to feel the effects of Patreon [banning Sargon of Akkad](/events/patreon-bans-sargon/).
Jordan Peterson tweeted out that he's lost about 2,000 followers on Patreon and asked if other content creators are experiencing something similar.

> I have lost about 2000 Patreons @Patreon since the debacle with Sargon of Akkad.
> I know @RubinReport is having the same trouble.
> Are other Patreon creators suffering similar losses as people bail out of the platform?
