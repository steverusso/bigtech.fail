YouTube banned [_MemoryHold_](https://gab.com/memoryhold), a political /
conspiracy theory channel, for ["violations of YouTube's policy prohibiting
content designed to harass, bully or
threaten."](https://archive.ph/JfUJe/image) The channel had about 23.5k
subscribers and nearly a million total views across 328 videos. In a video
update shortly after the ban, _MemoryHold_ [pointed
out](https://odysee.com/@MemoryHold:e/channel-suspension-announcement-stuff:d?t=75)
that it could be due to a recent video which talked about algorithmic
censorship:

> [...] it's poetic because my video covered the very algorithms that I think
> are responsible for detecting the content in my videos and targeting it for
> deletion. The content of the video is so sensitive that I imagine that's why
> they decided to just glass the entire channel [...].

The [appeal was quickly rejected](https://archive.is/yk7QM), and his backup
channel was eventually banned [for the same
reason](https://archive.ph/g4yhN/image) as his main channel. _MemoryHold_ was
banned [from Twitter](https://archive.ph/xnccI) on February 28, 2021 [and from
Instagram](https://archive.ph/KbRpo) a few days later. His [linktree page was
removed](https://archive.ph/7mg42) on May 6, 2021.
