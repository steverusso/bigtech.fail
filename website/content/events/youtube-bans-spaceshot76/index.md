[YouTube](/youtube/) banned [_Spaceshot76_](/profiles/spaceshot76/), a
political content creator, in an attempt to purge channels that the platform
claimed were spreading "harmful conspiracy theories." The year and a half old
channel had about **160k subscribers** and over **32.2 million total views**
across 791 videos.

_Spaceshot76_ immediately filed an appeal which was [promptly
rejected](appeal-rejection.jpg) the following day. Speaking to BigTech.fail,
_Spaceshot76_ pointed out how YouTube totally disregarded their own
three-strike system for nearly all channels banned around this time, including
his:

> They gave us ALL the same carbon copy email... Important to note YouTube has
> a 3 strike policy that they did not use... so long story short theyâ€™re
> playing games and they are not following their own rules.

_Spaceshot76_ was banned from both Twitter and Instagram about a week later
without any possibility for appeal.

About ten months prior in January, [YouTube issued three false strikes against
_Spaceshot76_](/e/youtube-three-false-strikes-on-single-spaceshot76-video/),
all within a month on a single video.
