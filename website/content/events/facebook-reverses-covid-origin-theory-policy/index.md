Facebook reversed its policy to now allow content that claims COVID was
'man-made' after President Biden asked U.S. intel agencies to investigate if
COVID leaked from the Wuhan lab. [_Politico_ reported the
following](https://archive.ph/NSJfx#selection-2069.0-2069.402) statement from a
Facebook spokesperson:

> “In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of COVID-19 and in
> consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim
> that COVID-19 is man-made from our apps,” the spokesperson said in an emailed
> statement. “We’re continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with
> the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new
> facts and trends emerge.”

It was uncertain at the time if Facebook would be lifting the restrictions or
bans placed on accounts that had previously violated this policy.
