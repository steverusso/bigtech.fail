Igan's channel _TheCrowhouse_ without warning. His **12 year old channel** had
over **237k subscribers** and nearly **22 million lifetime views**.

One of the last videos Max published, less than a week before his ban, was titled
"Welcome to the Wonderful World of We Control What You Can Say" (which can
still be viewed [on altCensored](https://www.altcensored.com/watch?v=hziVZBw4yDk)
and [on BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/video/hziVZBw4yDk/)). In it, he
points out how politicians are the ones causing real harm, not the virus:
> ...none of the economic hardship that we're seeing is a result of COVID-19.
> COVID-19 has done nothing to the world economy. What has happened to the
> world economy is it has been decimated by politicians, and they've used
> COVID-19 as the excuse to do that.
