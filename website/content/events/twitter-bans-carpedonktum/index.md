Twitter suspended @CarpeDonktum, otherwise known as "Donald Trump's favorite
meme maker." The account had about 273k followers. In [the ban
notice](ban-notice.jpg), Twitter said the ban was due to "multiple copyright
infringement notifications" which CarpeDonktum decided not to contest.

The copyright complaints, likely all frivolous since the content is clearly
fair use, were coincidentally filed after Trump tweeted one of CarpeDonktum's
videos. The video in the tweet got nearly 20 million views and the tweet itself
[was labeled](/events/twitter-labels-trump-tweet-as-manipulated-media/) as
"maninpulated media" by Twitter. Carpe Donktum [compiled all of the
videos](https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1122612088517787648) that had violations
filed against them.
