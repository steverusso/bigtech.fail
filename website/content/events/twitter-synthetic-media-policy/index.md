Twitter announced a new policy against "synthetic media" in a [blog
post](https://archive.is/USaDf) titled "Building rules in public: Our approach
to synthetic & manipulated media." The policy [was
summarized](https://archive.is/USaDf#selection-735.0-735.253) as follows:

> You may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely
> to cause harm. In addition, we may label Tweets containing synthetic and
> manipulated media to help people understand the mediaâ€™s authenticity and to
> provide additional context.
