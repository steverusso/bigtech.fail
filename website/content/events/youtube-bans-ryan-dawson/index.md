On January 27, 2021, YouTube removed a video from Ryan Dawson's channel titled
[_Palestine Peace Offer_](https://altcensored.com/watch?v=6otcC-QyAbM) for
"hate speech." The video was uploaded nearly a year prior on February 8, 2020
and was critical of Trump's Isreal-Palestine peace deal (which was [announced
about a week prior](https://archive.ph/B1RjR)), calling Trump "the worst
President on Palestine ever."

Immediately following this video removal (within a minute), YouTube outright
deleted Dawson's channel [due to](https://archive.ph/xLl5l/image) "violations
of YouTube's policy prohibiting hate speech." In [a video
update](https://www.bitchute.com/video/CdWlaho1dgCA/) the day after this
happened, Ryan Dawson said the following regarding his ban:

> A couple days ago, two videos got removed because, well, they talk about
> Jewish supremecy. [...] You can bash white supremecists all day, that's free
> speech. [...] You cannot talk about Jewish supremecy without being labeled a
> racist yourself. That's the world we live in.

In the _Palestine Peace Offer_ video (which was [reuploaded on
BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/video/Mde4qwHTfjKB/)), Dawson also talked
about some of the connections that big tech corporations have with some of the
most powerful governments, and how they heavily censor criticism of Isreal and
anti-war voices in general.

> There is nothing more disgusting, not even aid to Saudi Arabia reaches this
> level, and the way they are starving children in Yemen should be what
> everybody's screaming about, and almost no one is because it's not
> fashionable, because there are consequences. And if you criticize what
> Isreal's doing, you'll be censored.
