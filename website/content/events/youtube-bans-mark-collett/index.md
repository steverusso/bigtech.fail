Since his Google account was simultaneously deleted, Collett filed an appeal to
which [Google responded](google-appeal.png) "Thank you for contacting us about
your disabled Google account." The appeal was soon denied [with Google
saying](google-appeal-denied.png) "The email address you inquired about is not
associated with an active Google Account."

A channel named _Mark Collett Clips_ was deleted less than a week later on
April 28th.
