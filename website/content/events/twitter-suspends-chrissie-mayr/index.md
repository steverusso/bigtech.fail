Twitter suspended comedian and podcaster Chrissie Mayr after she tried to have
child porn accounts removed from Twitter by tweeting links to the accounts and
encouraging people to flag and report them. This, according to Twitter, was a
violation of the platform's Child Sexual Exploitation Policy.

> getting people to report it. Listen to that again

A couple of weeks later, in an interview with Michael Malice on his show "Your
Welcome", Chrissie Mayr [detailed](https://youtu.be/HI4pHc05muU?t=2351) the whole
situation again:
> ...I'm tweeting out about this account, like you guys gotta report
> this. And then I get banned from Twitter. I get suspended from Twitter for
> like a few hours. Meanwhile, it took Twitter like four hours to acknowledge
> the fact that we had reported this account. ... I wasn't like retweeting the
> child porn. I was just going like "This is this dude's account. We should all
> be reporting this guy."
