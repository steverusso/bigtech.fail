> I was censored today on Twitter. I focused there to take on the enemy on its

A Twitter spokesperson [told
Breitbart](https://archive.is/CUZi5#selection-565.0-565.169) that this
suspension was a mistake. Less than a week later, Twitter was caught [shadow
banning](/events/twitter-shadow-bans-lin-wood/) this account.
