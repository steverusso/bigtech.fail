Shortly after being temporarily suspended twice within two weeks (first [on Nov 2nd](/events/twitter-suspends-blonde-for-banter/) and then again [on Nov 13th](/events/twitter-suspends-blonde-for-tweeting-about-statistics/)), Blonde was permanently banned from Twitter.
No reason or possibility for appeal was given by Twitter.
Her account **@blonde_tweets** had about 20k followers when she was banned.

Blonde [released a video](https://www.bitchute.com/video/JC0oI3dxfglk/) covering her suspensions, the perma-ban, the fact that the rape and death threats she receives go unaddressed by Twitter, and more.

[During the Beauty and the Beta Sunday stream (#79)](https://youtu.be/6mq65f2Tpzk?t=205), Blonde perfectly summarized the reality of using Twitter as a creator:
> And it all comes to nothing. And then in one second, no email from Twitter, nothing. My account's gone.
> The eleven thousand tweets, all these interactions I've had with people, they're all gone.
> And it made me realize, like: Wow, I invested a shitload of time into a failing platform that wasn't making me any money, and it made me feel real stupid.

Thankfully, Blonde [moved over to Gab](https://gab.com/Blonde_Beast) and is active there:
