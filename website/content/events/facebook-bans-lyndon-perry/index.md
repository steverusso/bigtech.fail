Facebook banned Lyndon Perry, the founder and operator of _I,Hypocrite_, and
sole admin for the [_I,Hypocrite_ Facebook
page](https://www.facebook.com/ihypocrite). While Facebook did not give a
specific reason for disabling his account, they did offer an intrusive appeal
process. Speaking to BigTech.fail, Perry said:

> This account is the only admin on the I,Hypocrite page, so that page is now
> floating in limbo, unable to be managed.
>
> They did not give a reason, but an option to appeal, which then required me
> to upload a photo of myself and copy of driver's license.

After doing so, Facebook said that reviewing the information would take longer
to review than normal "due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic." Three days
later, Perry's account was suddenly reinstated, **except his admin capabilities
for _I,Hypocrite_ were disabled**.

[A restriction](page-ban-notice.jpg) placed on his account said he would be
"restricted from creating Pages" for the next three months. He received from
Facebook "no email, no message, no notification, nothing."
