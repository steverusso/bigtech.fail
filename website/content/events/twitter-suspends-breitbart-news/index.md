Breitbart News was one of the first accounts to get suspended by Twitter amid
the fallout from the [highly-censored](/events/white-coat-summit/) "White Coat
Summit." Twitter did not even respond to Breitbart's appeal for over two days.
According [to Breitbart](http://archive.is/3dVKn#selection-571.0-571.267):
> Breitbart News lodged an appeal with Twitter on Tuesday afternoon. Nearly 48
> hours later, Twitter has yet to respond or restore Breitbart’s ability to
> post. Twitter has not replied to a Breitbart News request for comment on how
> long such a review is expected to take.
