Twitter and [Facebook](/facebook/) purged accounts and pages
related to _PeaceData_, a website that was allegedly a Russian-backed
"information campaign." Twitter and Facebook both took these enforcement
actions based on information they received from the United States FBI (Federal
Bureau of Investigation). Below are exceprts from both of their summaries
celebrating cooperation with the FBI (emphasis ours):

> We suspended five Twitter accounts for platform manipulation that we can
> reliably attribute to Russian state actors. [...] The accounts purported to
> be associated with a website called PeaceData, which publishes a range of
> content about global political issues. At least some of the content published
> on the website was created by real people who appear to have contributed to
> PeaceData as freelancers. [...] <u>**We wish to express our gratitude to the
> @FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force for their close collaboration and
> continued support of our work to protect the public conversation at this
> critical time.**</u> [...]

> Agency (IRA). This activity focused primarily on the US, UK, Algeria and
> Egypt, in addition to other English-speaking countries and countries in the
> Middle East and North Africa. <u>**We began this investigation based on

Twitter [reiterated](https://archive.is/ZYAJN#selection-977.0-981.21) this
about a month later when they added the relevant data to their somewhat
permissioned archive as part of their "transparency" efforts:

> Working collaboratively with industry peers and the FBI, we were made aware
> of a number of accounts that had potential links to a fake news agency called
> PeaceData. They were immediately removed from the service and we’ve marked
> all links to the site as unsafe across the service.

To summarize in a different light: a government agency, that by itself has a
history of [murdering people](https://www.britannica.com/event/Ruby-Ridge),
told Twitter and Facebook that a website was bad, and the tech giants,
agreeing, proceeded to purge any accounts related to it. This couldn't possibly
be a slippery slope that backfires horribly in the future by leading to the
suppression of political dissidents and anti-establishment discourse online.
