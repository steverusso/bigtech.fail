[Google](/google/) threatened the free-speech platform [Minds](/alttech/minds/)
with removal from the Play Store due to the app hosting what Google deemed to
be controversial content. In order to avoid being removed from the Play Store,
Minds had to significantly reduce their mobile app functionality. The CEO Bill
Ottman explained:

> Google Play sent Minds a 24 hour warning. Our response app was accepted into
> the store based on our interim solution and ninja developers, but we had to
> remove major functionality from that version of the app. We did the same on
> iOS for obvious reasons. What is happening on the internet with major
> providers is fueling the cultural divide as much as anything. [...] We had
> to remove search, discovery and comments. I know. We aren't happy and will be
> working towards something better. [...]

This happened about a week after
[Google](/e/google-removes-parler-from-play-store/), [Apple and
Amazon](/e/apple-removes-parler-from-app-store/) deplatformed the
alternative social media site Parler for similar reasons.
