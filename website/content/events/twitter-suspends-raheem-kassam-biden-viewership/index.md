Twitter suspended Raheem Kassam for 12 hours after he [tweeted the
following](https://archive.is/UUMqz#selection-827.35-827.139) regarding the
very low viewership of a Joe Biden live stream titled "President Biden delivers
remarks on the American Rescue Plan":

> Remember, they claim he got 81 MILLION votes. Honeslty I’m starting to
> believe he didn’t get 18 MILLION.

Twitter did not give a specific reason other than "violating the Twitter
Rules," but it was likely due to questioning the outcome of the election.
