Facebook banned journalist Ford Fischer for no reason and without giving an
explanation:
> I am a journalist, verified on Facebook. Today I spent the entire day
> covering various armed groups throughout Louisville.
>
> As I just finished a livestream, I tried to log in and it appears @Facebook
> deleted my account.
>
> --Ford Fischer (@FordFischer) [5 Sep 2020](https://archive.is/SFBr3)

His Facebook account was reinstated about 24 hours later along with the ability
to "republish" his page:
> Total victory!
>
> Thank you so much to everybody who spent the past 24 hours complaining to
> Facebook.
>
> It appears that (without any sort of notification) my account was restored.
>
> My page was "unpublished" but it looks like that will be a one-click fix.
>
> This is people power.
