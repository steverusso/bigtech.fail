Twitter banned [Patrick Byrne](https://deepcapture.com/), the former CEO of
Overstock, likely due to his many tweets regarding the election fraud. He
briefly talked about his ban, among other things, [on the Rubin
Report](https://www.bitchute.com/video/Ut_KEsRlMmM/) shortly after it happened.

> I sat down with former Overstock CEO and tech giant @PatrickByrne who was
> banned from Twitter about two minutes before we recorded. We talk big tech,
> censorship and why @onlocals is the future of the social media.

Below are two of his final tweets in the days leading up to his ban, the second
of which was suppressed and labeled with: "This claim of election fraud is
disputed, and this Tweet canâ€™t be replied to, Retweeted, or liked due to a risk
of violence."

> Update on Georgia ballots: DHS had been trying to move forward this week. Two
> days ago FBI jumped in claiming jurisdiction. Yesterday 3 PM FBI took control
> of shredding truck and materials, directed they be returned to shredding
> operation and the shredding job completed.
