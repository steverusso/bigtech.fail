Facebook and Twitter banned [_The Free Thought
Project_](/profiles/free-thought-project/) in a coordinated purge of
anti-establishment accounts carried out under the guise of policing
"inauthentic activity." Their five year old Facebook page, which was verified,
had **3.1 million followers**.
> Facebook has unpublished our page 
>
> After 5 years of building fans Facebook has officially unpublished our page
> (3.1 million fans) so we can't post on it anymore. This is truly an outrage
> and we are devastated. We will do everything we can to recover our page and
> fight back.

Their five year old Twitter account (@TFTPROJECT) had **13.6k followers**.
> All but proving the case that this was a coordinated attack by the tech giant
> community, shortly after the purge on Facebook, Twitter followed suit, wiping
> out our profiles on there as well. They gave absolutely no reason for the
> suspension.
