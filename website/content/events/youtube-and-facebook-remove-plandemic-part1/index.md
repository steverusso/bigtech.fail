YouTube and Facebook removed a teaser trailer of an upcoming documentary titled "Plandemic", a film featuring Dr. Judy Mikovits.

This video _obviously_ contains highly questionable (if not outright false) claims by someone who has a questionable reputation.
From [RT's report](https://www.rt.com/usa/488215-plandemic-conspiracy-documentary-censorship/):
> ... it doesn’t help that Mikovits herself is far from an unbiased source on the subject.
> She’s been active in anti-vaccine and fringe circles for years, even while insisting she’s not “anti-vax” herself.

> These range from claims that wearing face masks "activates your own virus"
> (there’s no evidence of that) to the assertion that the devastating
> coronavirus outbreak in Northern Italy can be linked to the uptake in flu
> vaccination the year before (a claim which appears to be based on a
> misleading interpretation of one tangentially-related study, not any fresh
> research).

Facebook [told Reuters](https://archive.vn/NGmeZ#selection-549.0-549.123) that "Suggesting that wearing a mask can make you sick could lead to imminent harm, so we're removing the video",
and YouTube was obviously just following through on [the policy](/e/youtube-says-contradicting-who-will-violate-guidelines/) of removing any content that contradicts the WHO or is medically unsubstantiated.

As usual, the video is available on AltTech for free-thinking adults to digest and make their own decisions:
