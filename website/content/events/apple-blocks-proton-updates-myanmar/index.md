The country of Myanmar saw widespread protests after the military coup on
February 1, 2021. The military killed more than 250 people and imprisoned more
than 2,500. On March 17, the United Nations asked Myanmar citizens to gather
and submit any evidence of "crimes against humanity." They even [explicitly
recommended using ProtonMail and
Signal](https://archive.is/Zvh3i#selection-749.0-749.272). _On that same day_,
[Apple](/apple/) blocked updates for the ProtonVPN app, which saw exponential
growth during and after the coup, because of the language used in its
description, specifically the "challenging governments" part. Andy Yen, one of
the founders of Proton Technologies,
[wrote](https://archive.is/Md9qu#selection-675.0-675.237):

Apple has a rich history of thwarting individual sovereignty. For example, the
company [removed all VPN apps from the App Store in
China](/e/apple-removes-vpn-apps-from-china-app-store/) after the government
made them illegal in order to maintain its iron grip on the internet within the
country. They also [removed an app called HKmap.live during the peak of the
protests in Hong Kong](/e/apple-removes-hkmap-live-app/) which was heavily used
by protestors in order to avoid police.
