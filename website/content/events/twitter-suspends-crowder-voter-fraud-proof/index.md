Steven Crowder, host of _Louder With Crowder_, mentioned in a series of tweets
that he would be discussing verified evidence of voter fraud on his upcoming
show:

> Okay, Big Tech wants to play? Today I present dozens of non-existent voter
> addresses that I’ve verified MYSELF. From Michigan to Nevada. Empty lots etc.
> I’ll include pictures and a current newspaper as confirmation. It goes down
> today. 10AM ET.
>
> -- Steven Crowder (@scrowder) [23 Feb 2021](https://archive.vn/PWuiC)

> DOZENS of voter names, addresses, and pictures proving they don’t exist.
> Period. Today I’m tired of this shit. Mass voter fraud is real and I can
> prove it. 10AM ET. #LwC
>
> -- Steven Crowder (@scrowder) [23 Feb 2021](https://archive.vn/Fc87k)

> I can confirm to you that people voted from addresses that do not exist.

Twitter restricted the last two of those tweets and placed a warning on them
that read: **"This claim of election fraud is disputed, and this Tweet can’t be
replied to, Retweeted, or liked due to a risk of violence."** Additionally,
when Crowder uploaded the segment of his show where he discussed the votes from
addresses that do not exist, Twitter locked him out of his account for 12
hours. His account access was back in time for his show the following day:

> Was blocked from Twitter for the VERIFIABLE evidence of voter fraud posted
> yesterday. BUT I’M BACK! This morning, the Half Asian Kraken. #FightLikeHell
> #War (figuratively)
>

On the show, Crowder discussed the process him and his team went through to
obtain the data, start sifting through it, and ultimately verify beyond any
doubt that certain addresses did not exist:

> What I can tell you is we have hundreds more of these addresses, and when
> Twitter says 'unverified election fraud', the segment was verifying. That's
> exactly what it was. [...] Here's what we did: Step 1, we accumulated the
> voter data from government websites. [...] Then we checked the addresses to
> see if they were deliverable by UPS. Then we checked to see if there was a
> registered property at that address. And then we physically visited. [...] We
> physically visited said address and gave you the name of the voter from the
> address that doesn't exist. That is the verification process.

Crowder also covered the fact that Twitter **didn't even give a specific
reason** for taking down the tweet containing the video segment and then
locking his account. His lawyer, Bill Richmond, talked about how this is
essentially fraud:

> What it comes down is they have said 'This is the process. We will tell you
> why your tweets are restricted. Here are our policies. Read them, love them,
> follow them, and we will only act in these ways.' This is called fraud. This
> is when you say 'I have a platform that has certain rules, and if you play by
> the rules, we'll let you play', but then you change the rules.
