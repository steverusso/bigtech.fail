Twitter banned Mike Lindell (**@realMikeLindell**), the CEO of My
Pillow, for violating Twitter's Civic Integrity Policy by spreading "election
misinformation." Lindell [told the
StarTribune](https://archive.is/py6Ob#selection-1949.0-1949.168) that he had
been locked out of his account for the prior two weeks, only to be completely
banned after briefly regaining control of his account which had nearly **500k
followers**.

> Lindell's offense was allegedly committing "repeated violations" of Twitter's
> "civic integrity policy," which prohibits claims that "could undermine faith"
> in civic processes such as elections. Thank god we have this Tech Clergy to
> mandate faith-based adherence to civic virtues

> Mike Lindell, the My Pillow Guy, has been banned from Twitter for continuing
> to doubt the outcome of the election. Yet not a single Democrat has ever been
> suspended, not even temporarily, for posting false statements / conspiracy
> theories about Trump/Russia "stealing" the 2016 election.
