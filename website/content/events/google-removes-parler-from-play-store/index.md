[Google](/google/) removed the Parler app (a Twitter alternative) from the Play
Store shortly after it saw record traffic due to Twitter banning Trump. A
spokesperson for Google gave the following statement:

> In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies
> require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies
> and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite
> violence. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of
> this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the
> Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US. We recognize that
> there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be
> difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to
> distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement
> robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent
> public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play
> Store until it addresses these issues.

The [very next day](/e/apple-removes-parler-from-app-store/), Apple
followed suit by removing Parler from Apple's App Store, and Amazon disabled
Parler's servers on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
