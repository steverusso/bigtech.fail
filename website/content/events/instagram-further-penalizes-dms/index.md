Instagram announced that they would be [disabling the
accounts](https://archive.is/l7jJ6#selection-421.0-421.510) of users who "break
the rules" in their direct (private) messages:

> Today, we’re announcing that we’ll take tougher action when we become aware
> of people breaking our rules in DMs. Currently, when someone sends DMs that
> break our rules, we prohibit that person from sending any more messages for a
> set period of time. Now, if someone continues to send violating messages,
> we’ll disable their account. We’ll also disable new accounts created to get
> around our messaging restrictions, and will continue to disable accounts we
> find that are created purely to send abusive messages.

They also [proudly mention](https://archive.is/l7jJ6#selection-405.386-411.147)
how much "hate speech" was censored during a three month period the year prior,
including in DMs:

> Between July and September of last year, we took action on 6.5 million pieces
> of hate speech on Instagram, including in DMs, 95% of which we found before
> anyone reported it.
