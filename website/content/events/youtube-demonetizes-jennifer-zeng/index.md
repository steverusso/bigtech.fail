[YouTube](/youtube/) demonetized _Inconvenient Truths by Jennifer Zeng_, a
Chinese dissident and human rights activist, after she published a video titled
_Origin of the CCP Virus: The Missing Piece of the Puzzle_. While YouTube did
not give Zeng a specifc reason or explanation (rather just [a one sentence
notification](screenshot.jpg) on her channel's dashboard that said the channel
is no longer eligible for monetization), she probably violated [YouTube's
COVID-19
policies](/e/youtube-says-contradicting-who-will-violate-guidelines/) of
not disagreeing with the WHO.

> No reason was given. Just a sentence suddendly appearing on the backend of my
