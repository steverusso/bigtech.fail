Twitter temporarily suspended Ray Blanchard, a professor of psychiatry at the
University of Toronto, after he posted a series of tweets where he mentioned
that he believes "forms of gender dysphoria are types of mental disorder." The
entire tweet in the thread was:
> My beliefs include the following 6 elements: (1) Transsexualism and milder
> forms of gender dysphoria are types of mental disorder, which may leave the
> individual with average or even above-average functioning in unrelated areas
> of life.

About 24 hours later, Twitter unsuspended his account and
[apologized](https://archive.vn/MBjDF) saying "Twitter takes reports of
violations of the Twitter Rules very seriously. After reviewing your account,
it looks like we made an error."
