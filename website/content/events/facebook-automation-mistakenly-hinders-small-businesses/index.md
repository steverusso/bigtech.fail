Sarah Frier for Bloomberg [published a report](https://archive.is/h0MBr) on how
Facebook's automation was negatively effecting small businesses. HoneyGramz and
Ivonne Sanchez are two businesses [the article
highlights](https://archive.is/h0MBr#selection-3437.218-3441.133) that had
their ad accounts disabled, and a "pizza vending machine company, a reusable
water bottle company, a coffee delivery service, a business coach and a hair
weave company" [were all
suspended](https://archive.is/h0MBr#selection-3731.195-3743.70).

As [Frier pointed out](https://archive.is/h0MBr#selection-3723.0-3723.206),
these "mistakes" by Facebook have greater consequences for small businesses
than what it might seem like at first:

> Even if an ad account gets restored, businesses lose crucial momentum.
> Facebookâ€™s advertising algorithm takes a couple of weeks to figure out which
> users may be interested in an ad, to refine the targeting.

Could this all be a result of Facebook [leaning into _automated_ content
removal](https://archive.is/h0MBr#selection-4191.0-4195.213) and [taking even
more aggressive measures](/e/facebook-demotes-election-misinformation/) toward
policing "misinformation" (the latter being announced just one week prior to
this)?
