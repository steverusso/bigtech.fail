An 85 page briefing from Google titled "The Good Censor" was leaked exclusively to Breitbart detailing how BigTech is starting to move away from free speech and why.
Below are some highlights that Breitbart points out in [their report](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/09/the-good-censor-leaked-briefing-says-google-must-move-away-from-american-tradition-of-free-speech-to-expand-globally-attract-advertiser-s/) (and [followup report](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/09/the-good-censor-google-admits-concerns-about-political-neutrality-are-now-mainstream/)):

> Pages 19-21 of the briefing describe this initial support for free speech as
> a "utopian narrative" that has been undermined by political events including
> the 2016 election and the rise of the populist AfD party in Germany.

> ... on pages 66-70, the briefing explains that tech companies including
> Google, Facebook and Twitter initially leaned towards an "American tradition"
> of free speech that prioritizes "free speech for democracy, not civility."
> But it goes on to say that the same companies now embrace the "European
> tradition," that favors "dignity over liberty, and civility over freedom."
