Twitter suspended journalist Jack Posobiec shortly after he changed his profile
name to ["Ukrainian Gas Expert Poso"](https://archive.vn/OIf2g) and tweeted a
Hunter Biden meme. Twitter [classified this](notice.jpg) as "distribution of
hacked material" as this was amidst the [New York Post exposÃ© on Hunter
Biden](/events/facebook-twitter-suppress-nypost-hunter-expose/).
