Google, Facebook and Twitter [once
again](/e/google-facebook-twitter-help-us-gov-seize-domain-names/) assisted the
United States Department of Justice, specifically the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, in seizing 27 more domain names that were allegedly being used
to promote Iranian propaganda. An excerpt from [the press
release](https://archive.is/t9qAb#selection-581.0-581.582) reads as follows:

> As described in the seizure documents, all 27 domains were being used in
> violation of U.S. sanctions targeting both the Government of Iran and the
> IRGC. Four of the domains purported to be genuine news outlets but were
> actually controlled by the IRGC and targeted audiences in the United States,
> to covertly influence United States policy and public opinion, in violation
> of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The remainder targeted
> audiences in other parts of the world.

As is typically the case, the corporations and the government praise one
another after they take an action like this. This time, [an FBI agent gave a
shout out](https://archive.is/t9qAb#selection-593.0-593.589) to the social
media corporations, as usual, and then mentioned that because of the "ongoing
collaboration with Google, Facebook, and Twitter", the FBI can continue to
"pursue any attempts by foreign actors to spread disinformation in our
country."

> “The FBI is aggressively investigating any evidence of foreign influence and
> the unlawful spread of disinformation by hostile nations. Today, we seized 27
> additional domains that Iran’s IRGC was illegally using in attempt to
> manipulate public opinion in other countries, including the United States,”
> said FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig D. Fair. “Thanks to our ongoing
> collaboration with Google, Facebook, and Twitter, the FBI was able to disrupt
> this Iranian propaganda campaign and we will continue to pursue any attempts
> by foreign actors to spread disinformation in our country.”

As journalist Mark Ames pointed out, a side bonus of these actions is that the
US corporate media, aka. the propaganda arm of _the US_ government, has less
competition:

> This will only get worse in the coming years, thanks to corporate media
> collusion with spy agencies to sow panic & fear that unofficial media
> critical of US empire must be controlled by State Enemies.
>
> Added bonus: less competition for corporate media.
