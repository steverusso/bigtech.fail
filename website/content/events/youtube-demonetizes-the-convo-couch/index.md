[YouTube](/youtube/) demonetized _The Convo Couch_, a progressive political
show hosted by Fiorella Isabel. YouTube only gave [a vague
explanation](notice.jpg) of "harmful content" and did not cite specific
guideline violations.

> Well folks we’ve been entirely demonetized let’s see how many people care
> about actual independent leftist media now being directly targeted by YouTube
> aka GOOGLE for taking away from MSM & telling the truth. Now I hope you
> understand why I’m extremely anti censorship.
