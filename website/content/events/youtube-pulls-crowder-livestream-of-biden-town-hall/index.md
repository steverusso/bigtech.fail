YouTube pulled a _Louder With Crowder_ livestream of a Joe Biden CNN Town Hall
event and issued a community guideline strike based on copyright infringement.
The copyright complaint turned out to be fraudulent from someone who had
repeatedly filed false copyright claims. Crowder and his half-Asian lawyer Bill
Richmond summarized the situation [on the
show](https://www.bitchute.com/video/jMf3oj4T8oE/) a few days later:
> **(Bill Richmond):** The DMCA does say that if you get a valid complaint that
> is signed under penalty of perjury and all that, and they represent who they
> are, then you have to take this material down. However, this person is a
> known quantity.  The email that was used to send this particular request was
> already flagged in 2019 and 2018, publicly, as someone who had falsely
> represented that they were part of various media companies. That's besides
> the fact that this wasn't even a copyright violation at all.
>
> **(Steven Crowder):** And guess what? We don't get that revenue back. When
> you're doing a stream, and it's getting more viewers than CNN, ... you don't
> get it back.
