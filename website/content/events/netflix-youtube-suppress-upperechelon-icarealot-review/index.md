[YouTube](/youtube/) honored a copyright complaint manually filed by
[Netflix](/netflix/) against a video published by _Upper Echelon Gaming_ that
was a review of the recent Netflix movie _I Care A Lot_. The video simply
played clips of the movie in the background without audio. YouTube suppressed
and demonetized the video, but it is still fully available [on
Odysee](https://odysee.com/@UpperEchelonGamers:3/massively-over-hyped-i-care-a-lot-review:2).

> Someone from Netflix manually claimed my "I Care a Lot" review. It got
> blocked for 65% of my audience as a result and no monetization allowed. 
>
> I have disputed, but who knows how that goes. 
>
> Fuck you @netflix ... go back to making CP like cuties. Wait, maybe don't.

> Oh yeah, and your movie fuckin sucks. Get over it. Just because my review is
> continuing to climb in viewership showcasing how bad it actually is doesn't
> mean one of your tech monkeys can illegally strike it down.
