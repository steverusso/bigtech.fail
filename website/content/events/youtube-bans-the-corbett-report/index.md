YouTube banned _The Corbett Report_, hosted by James Corbett, after issuing the
channel its third strike for "medical misinformation." The channel had **559k
subscribers** and nearly **92 million total views** across 1,766 videos. The
following is an excerpt from [the blog
post](https://www.corbettreport.com/mission-accomplished-the-corbett-report-removed-from-youtube/)
James Corbett wrote about the ban:

A few weeks prior, James Corbett released [a video which
covered](https://odysee.com/@corbettreport:0/hellogoing:1?t=279) (in part) the
fact that he was, at the time, suspended from YouTube after receiving a second
strike. He said he would not self-censor and would force YouTube to make a
move:

Unsurprisingly, _The Corbett Report_ received a third strike and was deleted
_just hours_ after uploading an episode titled ["Science
Says"](https://odysee.nearlycom/@corbettreport:0/ep398-sciencesays:2), a play
on the kids game "Simon Says":

Over the prior few years, but particularly 2020, YouTube had removed several
videos from the _Corbett Report_ channel. James Corbett compiled a list of
those videos
[here](https://www.corbettreport.com/youtube-banned-these-videos-here-they-are/)
with links to the alternative platforms where they are still available.
Luckily, he has been growing his audience on alternative platforms all along,
and [_The Corbett Report_'s Odysee
channel](https://odysee.com/@corbettreport:0) surpassed 100k subscribers [less
than a month prior](https://archive.ph/KvUOC)!
