Amid the increased censorship that followed the [US capitol
riot](/t/us-capitol-riot/), many users began the migration to alternative
platforms (AltTech). Parler, a Twitter / Facebook alternative, saw so much
increased traffic that
[Google](/events/google-removes-parler-from-play-store/), [Apple and
Amazon](/events/apple-removes-parler-from-app-store/) all deplatformed Parler,
which temporarily took the entire platform completely offline.

On the other hand, **Gab** (another Twitter / Facebook alternative), had
already been targeted and mass deplatformed a few years prior. Their Android
app was first [removed from the Google Play
Store](/events/google-removes-gab-from-play-store/) in August of 2017 and then
(after rebranding, reengineering, and gaining reentrance into the Google Play
Store) was [once again removed](/events/google-bans-gab-from-play-store-again/)
in July of 2019 shortly after trending as the #1 app. Not only that, but Gab's
CEO Andrew Torba, _as well as his family_, have been [financially
blacklisted](https://archive.is/YTQNV) by major payment platforms and
processors.

Therefore, Gab did not get taken offline as Parler did. Gab did the work years
ago by building out their own infrastructure so that a small set of
corporations couldn't just take Gab offline at the snap of a finger. The site
did, however, see _so much new traffic_ during this censorship frenzy that the
it was unusable at times. In a blog post a couple of weeks later, Torba
[mentioned](https://archive.is/f2pzV#selection-567.0-567.224) Gab's recent
record growth:

> In the past 30 days the Gab community has grown by millions of people from
> around the world. Weâ€™ve seen over 24 million visitors and 177 million page
> views over the past few weeks alone. Our business is growing and quickly.

Additionally, applications for Gab Pro (Gab's premium membership which allows
for, among other features, verification) spiked as well, numbering in the
thousands:

> To those who applied for Gab verification: please be patient. We are
> backlogged by thousands of applications which we are working diligently to
> process. We have a small, but growing team dedicated to this. Thank you for
> understanding!
