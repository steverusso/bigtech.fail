Less than a week after [the Rose/Icke II](/events/youtube-removes-rose-icke-ii/) controversy and [the attacks that followed](/events/london-real-gets-content-removed-from-several-major-platforms/), London Real was suspended from LinkedIn.

Brian Rose released [a short vlog](https://www.bitchute.com/video/zcJg-gHj6Q8/) on the matter, with two key highlights.
The first is how important it is to not think like a victim:
> Now look, I'm not a victim. I don't care. F*ck 'em.
> And I'm going to keep moving foward. This will not change my editorial opinion.
> And this still does not change how I feel, and that is that we have the right to speak our minds.

And secondly, how important it is to keep in mind the very _human_ element within BigTech:
> I'm sending love and peace out to everybody out in the world, including my good friends at LinkedIn, including my good friends at YouTube, including my good friends at Facebook and Dropbox and Vimeo.
> You do what you gotta do.
> We're still sending you love because what we're doing, ultimately that's gonna get the message out there.

The London Real LinkedIn account [was reinstated](https://www.bitchute.com/video/VbeFSEJ19QE/) about three days later after online protest from many London Real fans.
