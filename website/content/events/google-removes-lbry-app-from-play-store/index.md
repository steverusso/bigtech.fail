Google removed the [LBRY app](https://lbry.com/what) from the Play Store
because they claimed the app "contains content doesn't comply with the Sexual
Content and Profanity policy."
> LBRY for Android has been suspended.
>
> Google doesn't believe you should be allowed to decide for yourself about
> what you want to read, watch and hear.

This situation is very similar to when Google [removed the Gab
app](/events/google-bans-gab-from-play-store-again/) in the sense that these
apps are not able to censor the content that they allow you to access.
> LBRY allows anyone to have a voice
>
> Our unique design means no one, even us, can take your right to publish away
>
> That's why it's so utterly terrifying to the establishment
>
> They're used to being in control
