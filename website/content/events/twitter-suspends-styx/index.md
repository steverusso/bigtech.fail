Twitter [temporarily suspended](notice.png) Styxhexenhammer666 for "glorifying
violence" based on the following tweet regarding [Kyle
Rittenhouse](/context/kyle-rittenhouse/):

> Not only was Kyle Rittenhouse justified, he's a hero who stood up against
> violent commie rioters and won. He's more a man than most of the Kenosha
> population and he's a fucking 17 year old.
