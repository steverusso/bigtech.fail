Sargon of Akkad was banned from Patreon for using offensive language during a guest appearance on another YouTube channel about a year prior.
No, this is not made up: this is [according to Patreon](https://patreonhq.com/hate-speech-on-patreon-a9026e52c2cf).

This controversy set off a chain reaction of events, such as the conceptual planning of this site itself.

Shortly after, _#PatreonPurge_ was created [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23PatreonPurge) and [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PatreonPurge).

Also, Sargon did a great 10-part video series (all links to BitChute videos) detailing the controversy:
