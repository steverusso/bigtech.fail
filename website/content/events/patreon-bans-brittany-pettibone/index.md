Patreon banned author and journalist Brittany Pettibone due to her association
with Defend Europe, a Generation Identity campaign that has disavowed political
violence.

This ban from Patreon is even slightly worse than [the Lauren Southern
ban](/e/patreon-bans-lauren-southern/) since here the claim is simply that she
"supports" Defend Europe, not that she did anything.
