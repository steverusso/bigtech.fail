Facebook and Instagram suppressed Tucker Carlson's interview with [Dr. Li-Meng
Yan](/events/twitter-bans-dr-li-meng-yan/) by forcing users to navigate around
a warning overlayed on the video stating that it was "false information." In
Tucker's
[monologue](https://www.facebook.com/TuckerCarlsonTonight/videos/652543642048920/)
the following day, he summarizes:
> So Facebook suppressed the video, presumably on behalf of the Chinese
> government. Facebook executives made it harder for users to watch our
> segment. Those who found the video had to navigate a warning ...
>
> Instagram, which Facebook also owns, did the same thing.

Tucker went on to point out that the "fact checks" that Facebook and Instagram
linked to had been published many months ago:
> They were written before anyone knew who she was.
>
> The truth is, and you know it if you've watched carefully, experts have been
> wrong frequently throughout this pandemic.

Both platforms did the same thing to his follow-up
[Facebook](https://archive.vn/XHNjl) and [Instagram
posts](https://archive.is/1YMoY) that he made regarding the suppression of the
previous posts.
