Patreon banned _The Last American Vagabond_ for "spreading medical
misinformation" about a week after Patreon's "Trust & Safety" team threatened
him with account removal unless all of the "medical misinformation" content was
removed. Patreon only gave one examle of such violative content, but that
content actually cited the WHO:

> The cowardly @Patreon told me that I (The Last American Vagabond) will not be
> able to use their failing & soon to be obsolete platform unless I delete all
> "medical misinformation" on COVID. Despite the fact that the TLAV link they
> give is citing the WHO🤦‍♂️.🦠🤡🌎 #BoycottPatreon

[The warning notice](warning.jpg) that Patreon sent to _The Last American
Vagabond_ stated that all "medical misinformation" needs to be removed **and
reiterated Patreon's now long-stated policy of having their guidelines "extend
to any projects that you fund via Patreon"**:

> Hello, My name is Vesper and I'm on the Trust & Safety team here at Patreon.
> [...] I took a look and reviewed your creator page today. In order to bring
> your page back within our guidelines, kindly review and remove any and all
> content that advances COVID-19 medical misinformation. [...] Additionally,
> since our guidelines extend to any projects that you fund via Patreon, this
> means that online content linked to your creator page is subject to our
> guidelines.

About a week later, Patreon deleted the account. It had **over 450 patrons**
prior to the initial warning notice (which is when _TLAV_ started encouraging
his followers to support through a different mechanism) and **about 370
patrons** the day it was deleted.

> Annnd it's gone! @Patreon did what we expected them to do, they sold out. And
> long before censoring me (TLAV). Today, @PatreonSupport has officially
> suspended my account until I delete my own content. Cowards. Can't do your
> own dirty work? #BoycottPatreon
