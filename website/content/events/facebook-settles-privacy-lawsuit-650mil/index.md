Back in July of 2020, Facebook offered $650 million to settle a privacy
lawsuit, filed under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, which
alleged that the company used facial recognition features without their users'
consent. This settlement was finally approved about seven months later: [The
Chicago Tribune reported](https://archive.is/s10mn#selection-3039.1-3087.272):

> The Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act is among the strictest such
> laws in the U.S., and requires companies to get permission before using
> technologies such as facial recognition to identify customers.
>
> [...]
>
> Out of the $650 million Facebook agreed to pay, Donato awarded $97.5 million
> in attorneys’ fees and about $915,000 in expenses. The court also awarded
> $5,000 to each of the three named plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The rest is to
> be distributed to all class members equally.

Around this same time, [TikTok settled a very similar
lawsuit](https://archive.is/M1vVZ) (also filed under the Illinois Biometric
Information Privacy Act) for $92 million.
