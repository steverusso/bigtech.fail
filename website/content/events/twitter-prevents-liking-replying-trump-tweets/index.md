[Twitter](/twitter/) disabled the ability to like or reply to several of
President Trump's tweets as he was ranting about the Supreme Court, Attorney
General Bill Barr, and the Republican establishment. A few hours later, Twitter
re-enabled the ability to like and reply to the tweets in question while
leaving a _"This claim about election fraud is disputed"_ label on nearly all
of them. The targeted tweets included the following:

> “Justices Alito and Thomas say they would have allowed Texas to proceed with
> its election lawsuit.” @seanhannity This is a great and disgraceful
> miscarriage of justice. The people of the United States were cheated, and our
> Country disgraced. Never even given our day in Court!

> I WON THE ELECTION IN A LANDSLIDE, but remember, I only think in terms of
> legal votes, not all of the fake voters and fraud that miraculously floated
> in from everywhere! What a disgrace!

> Who is a worse governor, @BrianKempGA of Georgia or @dougducey of Arizona???
> These are two RINO Republicans who fought against me and the Republican Party
> harder than any Democrat. They allowed states that I won easily to be stolen.
> Never forget, vote them out of office!

> IF Biden gets in, nothing will happen to Hunter or Joe. Barr will do nothing,
> and the new group of partisan killers coming in will quickly kill it all.
> Same thing with Durham. We caught them cold, spying, treason & more (the hard
> part), but “Justice” took too long. Will be DOA!

> The Supreme Court had ZERO interest in the merits of the greatest voter fraud
> ever perpetrated on the United States of America. All they were interested in
> is “standing”, which makes it very difficult for the President to present a
> case on the merits. 75,000,000 votes!
