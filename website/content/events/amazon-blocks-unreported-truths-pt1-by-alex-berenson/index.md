Amazon blocked the publication of _Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and
Lockdowns: Part 1: Introduction and Death Counts and Estimates_ by Alex
Berenson because the book [did not comply](notice.jpg) with the company's
guidelines.
> Today @amazon refused to publish my booklet about the coronavirus because it
> “did not comply” with their (undisclosed) guidelines. This is outrageous
> censorship from a company that has gained hugely from lockdowns - and
> dominates the US book market, especially with stores closed!

Amazon coincidentally reversed their decision shorty after Elon Musk [brought
attention](http://archive.is/90pBi) to the situation. Two days later, the book
[hit #1](https://reclaimthenet.org/alex-berensons-lockdown-skeptic-book-rockets-top-of-kindle-charts/)
on the Amazon Kindle charts.
