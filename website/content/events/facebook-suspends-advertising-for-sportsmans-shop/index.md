[The Sportsman's Shop](https://thesportsmansshop.com/), a small shooting and
outdoors store, had their advertising capabilities suspended by Facebook due to
the fact that the store's Facebook page contained promotional links / content
for firearms.

From [the Daily Caller](https://archive.vn/ERG21#selection-1983.193-1983.451):
> Due to the fact that The Sportsman’s Shop’s Facebook page — as well as its
> hyperlinked website embedded into that page — is filled with content
> promoting the sales of guns and showing in-house firearm training, the store
> could no longer advertise altogether.
