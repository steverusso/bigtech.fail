The day after confronting CNN activist Oliver Darcy and several others in Washington D.C., Twitter decided to ban Alex Jones for violating their "abusive behavior policy."
Oliver Darcy had [tried to get Jones banned](https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/09/media/twitter-infowars-alex-jones/index.html) in the past.

This ban from Twitter came one month after [Jones was banned from several major platforms](/e/alex-jones-mass-banned/) over the course of a couple days, and three weeks after [his temporary suspension from Twitter](/e/twitter-suspends-alex-jones/).

The accounts that were banned were **@realalexjones**, which had about 900k followers, and **@infowars**, which had about 430k followers.

The [@TwitterSafety](https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1037804427992686593) account tweeted about the decision to ban Jones:
> Today, we permanently suspended **@realalexjones** and **@infowars** from Twitter and Periscope.
> We took this action based on new reports of Tweets and videos posted yesterday that violate our abusive behavior policy, in addition to the accountsâ€™ past violations.
