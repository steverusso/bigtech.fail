[YouTube](/youtube/) removed two videos from Senator Ron Johnson's channel for
violating [YouTube's COVID-19
policies](/events/youtube-says-contradicting-who-will-violate-guidelines/). The
videos were of doctors testifying at a US Senate hearing about different
COVID-19 treatments. However, the content is still allowed to remain [on
Bloomberg's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8RyV3VEDKI).

> Social media censorship just ratcheted up to a new level. Google’s YouTube
> removed two videos of doctors testifying under oath at my US Senate hearing
> on early treatment of COVID. Another body blow to freedom of speech and
> expression. Very sad and scary. Where does this end?
