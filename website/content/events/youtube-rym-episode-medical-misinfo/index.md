YouTube removed an episode of [_Run Your
Mouth_](https://soundcloud.com/user-534644803-655409170), a podcast hosted by
[Robbie The Fire Bernstein](https://www.robbiethefire.com/), for "medical
misinformation" related to COVID despite the fact that he was [just asking
questions](https://youtu.be/zT0PpnW1_DE?t=2242), particularly in regards to the
J&J vaccine that was pulled from the market and re-released after a label was
added to it:

> [...] it says "any claims that go against the official statement of WHO or
> local health officials." And now to be fair, I wasn't making any claims. It
> was questions and jokes. So, just to look at the extent of YouTube censorship
> [...], you're not even allowed to ask questions.

The episode is still available [on
Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-534644803-655409170/dont-trust-the-hippie-banks).
