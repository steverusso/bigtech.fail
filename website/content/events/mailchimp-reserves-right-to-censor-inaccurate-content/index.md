[Mailchimp](/mailchimp/) updated their approximately 6,200 word Terms of
Service to include [the following gem](https://archive.is/spOEk#selection-2883.0-2883.230):

> Mailchimp also does not allow the distribution of Content that is, in our
> sole discretion, materially false, inaccurate, or misleading in a way that
> could deceive or confuse others about important events, topics, or
> circumstances.

Up until this point, Mailchimp had already terminated _at least_ the following
