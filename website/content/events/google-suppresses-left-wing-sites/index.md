On September 19, 2017, the [_World Socialist Web Site
(WSWS)_](https://www.wsws.org/) published [a
report](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/09/19/goog-s19.html) on how
several progressive / left-wing / anti-war websites had seen dramatic drops in
their traffic from Google Search over the prior few months. The _WSWS_ had
themselves seen a 74% drop in traffic. Their report, which was actually a
follow-up to [one they
published](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2017/07/27/goog-j27.html) about a
month prior, [included the following
sites](https://archive.ph/GjPrI#selection-729.0-751.146) and their
corresponding drops in traffic between April to September of 2017:

Site | % traffic decrease<br>(from Apr-Sep)
---|---
Alternet | -71%
Global Research | -62%
Democracy Now | -50%
Common Dreams | -50%
Truth-out.org | -49%

The article [concludes with the
following](https://archive.ph/GjPrI#selection-855.0-859.226):

> Googleâ€™s actions against the World Socialist Web Site and other left and
> progressive sites are making clear the real targets of Internet censorship:
> news outlets and political organizations opposing war, social inequality and
> the domination of society by the financial oligarchy.
