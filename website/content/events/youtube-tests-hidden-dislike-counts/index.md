[YouTube](/youtube/) started rolling out hidden dislikes to a small group of
creators for testing:

> In response to creator feedback around well-being and targeted dislike
> campaigns, we're testing a few new designs that don't show the public dislike
> count. If you're part of this small experiment, you might spot one of these
> designs in the coming weeks (example below!).
>
> Creators, you'll still be able to see the exact number of likes and dislikes
> in YouTube Studio. For viewers, if you're in the experiment, you can still
> like or dislike a video to share feedback with creators and help tune the
> recommendations you see on YouTube.

There are at least a couple things about this that simply don't make sense:

1. In the announcement itself, YouTube said hiding dislikes is for creators'
	 "well-being" but also that creators will still be able to see the number of
	 likes and dislikes...?
2. The option to hide the likes and dislikes for a video already exists.
	 Creators can optionally enable this right now with ease. Why introduce the
	 sitewide concealment of dislikes only?

YouTube [started
considering](https://reclaimthenet.org/youtube-getting-rid-dislike-button/)
something like "removing the dislike button" about a month or two after
[_YouTube Rewind 2018_](https://archive.ph/n5YTE) become the most disliked
video on YouTube [within a week of being
uploaded](https://reclaimthenet.org/youtube-rewind-2018-becomes-youtubes-most-disliked/).
It still is the most disliked video on YouTube with over **19M dislikes** and
only 2.9M likes, and _YouTube Rewind 2019_ is currently [the 6th most disliked
video on YouTube](https://archive.ph/2Ifov#selection-933.0-982.0). More
recently, over the past few months, [YouTube was caught removing thousands of
dislikes](https://reclaimthenet.org/youtube-scrubs-thousands-of-dislikes-from-joe-biden-videos-on-official-white-house-channel/)
from several videos on the official White House channel which were consistently
getting ratioed pretty hard.

Regardless, users and creators alike were incredibly ~~disappointed~~ overjoyed
with this announcement and left tons of ~~negative~~ positive feedback in the
replies to YouTube's announcement tweet:

> this sucks. youtube is feeling less of a social network website and feeling
> more like cable TV. the dislike video shows people if for example a tutorial
> is trust worthy, and is already able to be disabled. please do not do this.
