Twitter banned Distributed Denial of Secrets (@DDoSecrets) for distributing
hacked material the day after their _BlueLeaks_ data was published. This data
dump contained millions of files from over 200 police departments and law
enforcement facilities.

ZDNet was able to [get a little more
info](https://archive.is/r5RLF#selection-2041.16-2045.107) from Twitter:
> ...Twitter told ZDNet that the BlueLeaks data did indeed contain unredacted
> information that could have put individuals at risk of real-world harm.
>
> The company said its platform's policy strictly forbids the dissemination of
> hacked materials of any kind, ...

Twitter also prevented users from posting links to the _BlueLeaks_ data dump.
