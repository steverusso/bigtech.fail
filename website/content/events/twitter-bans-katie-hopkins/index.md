Katie Hopkins (**@KTHopkins**) was permanently banned from Twitter for "abuse
and hateful conduct." The account had more than 1.1 million followers. Twitter
did not give a specific reason or cite a specific tweet, but the platform did
issue the following statement:
> Keeping Twitter safe is a top priority for us -- abuse and hateful conduct
> have no place on our service and we will continue to take action when our
> rules are broken. In this case, the account has been permanently suspended
> for violations of our Hateful Conduct policy.

Hopkins was [temporarily suspended](/events/twitter-suspends-katie-hopkins/)
about six months prior after activists demanded Twitter take action against her
account. Her blue check verification was removed several hours before being
permanently banned.
