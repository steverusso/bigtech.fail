YouTube deleted Jordan Sather's channel _Destroying the Illusion_ (as well as
its backup channel _Destroying the Illusion 2.0_) in an attempt to purge
channels that the platform claimed were spreading "harmful conspiracy
theories." The four year old channel had **238k subscribers** and over **35
million total views**.
> YouTube's reason for the terminating is "malicious harassment", yet they do
> not specify exactly what the harassment was in their emails to the content
> creators. One can assume they are using this "harassment" excuse to remove
> videos and channels that are reporting on the new Hunter Biden revelations.
> Twitter was similarly removing tweets pertaining to the story yesterday with
> their excuses ranging from "hacked material" to "private information".
