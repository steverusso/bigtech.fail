After Austin Peterson announced that his Senate campaign would be accepting Bitcoin donations, his political opposition suggested that he was associated with Russian hacking efforts.
Peterson replied with a GIF of Joseph Stalin that had the phrase "off to the Gulag."
This GIF was from Twitter's own GIF library.

His political opposition stepped up the attack by mass-reporting his Twitter account, subsequently landing him with a 12 hour suspension.

In [a statement](https://archive.vn/z4uhL#selection-2349.21-2349.240) given to KCTV, Peterson said:
> Twitter and Democratic aligned super PACs are interfering with the federal senate race in Missouri by temporarily blocking my account due to a picture I shared which was located within Twitter's own GIF file collection.
