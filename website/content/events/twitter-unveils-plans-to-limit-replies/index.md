Suzanne Xie, Twitterâ€™s director of product management, let the world know about one of Twitter's upcoming downgrades: restrictions on conversation.

More specifically, users will be able to control the conversation around what they tweet.
On the compose screen, users will be presented four options: Global, Group, Panel, and Statement.
From [The Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056856/twitter-replies-limit-option-compose-screen-beta-app-features-new-ces-2020):
> Xie says Twitter is adding a new setting for "conversation participants" right on the compose screen.
> It has four options: "Global, Group, Panel, and Statement."
> Global lets anybody reply, Group is for people you follow and mention, Panel is people you specifically mention in the tweet, and Statement simply allows you to post a tweet and receive no replies. (No word on whether Statement also automatically formats your tweet as a classic iPhone Notes app apology, but it should.)
