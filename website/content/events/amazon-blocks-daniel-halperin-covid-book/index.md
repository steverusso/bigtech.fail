Amazon blocked the publication of _Coping With Covid-19: 12 Common Myths and 12
Lesser Known Facts about the Pandemic: Clearly Explained by an Epidemiologist_
by Daniel Halperin because, according to Amazon, the book [did not
comply](notice.jpg) with the company's guidelines. Reclaim The Net pointed out
what had become the obvious pattern at this point with Amazon:
> This concerns Amazon’s e-book publishing arm, where the very mention of the
> virus apparently now means that “nothing gets through.”

Amazon eventually reversed the decision, and the book was allowed publication.
