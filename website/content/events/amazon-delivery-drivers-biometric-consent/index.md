About a month and half prior, Amazon announced its plans to install
surveillance systems in all of its delivery trucks. These systems, made by a
company called Netradyne, have a series of camera views, one of which is on the
driver, and will alert the driver via audio commands when it thinks the driver
is doing something dangerous. While at the time it is "not" livestreaming the
feed to Amazon, certain portions can be automatically uploaded.

Now, Amazon is forcing the drivers to sign a 'biometic consent' form in order
to keep their jobs. This includes consenting to the collection of the driver's
"photograph," collected via the "on-board camera safety technology," among
other "biometric data." Lauren Kaori Gurley for Vice
[reported](https://archive.is/7D3qe#selection-975.0-975.254):

> If the company’s delivery drivers, who number around 75,000 in the United
> States, refuse to sign these forms, they lose their jobs. The form requires
> drivers to agree to facial recognition and other biometric data collection
> within the trucks they drive.

> Technically, these drivers aren't even employed by Amazon, but by roughly 800
> companies, known as delivery service partners that operate out of Amazon
> delivery stations. Still, Amazon controls many aspects of its drivers working
> conditions, from their training to their uniforms to their delivery quotas.
