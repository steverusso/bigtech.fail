Google removed the Gab Android app from the Play Store one week after they [demanded that Gab censor content](/events/google-gives-gab-a-week-to-censor-uncensorable-content/) that Gab couldn't even censor if they wanted to.

In a [statement given to Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/07/20/google-blacklists-free-speech-platform-gabs-latest-app/), Gab founder Andrew Torba said:
> Google has banned Gab's decentralized and open-source mobile app from their Google Play Store, claiming that it has "non-compliant user-generated content such as hate speech."
> The Gab android app contains no user content.
> It is effectively a web browser that allows anyone to connect to any one of the thousands of decentralized microblogging servers, Gab included.
> So by Google's own standards, the Google Chrome web browser is also violating their user-generated content policy.

This is the second time Gab has had their Android app removed from the Google Play Store.
The first time this happened was [back in August 2017](/events/google-removes-gab-from-play-store/) when Gab refused to comply with demands for censorship that were at least _possible_ to comply with.
This time, however, they could not have complied with the censorship demands from Google _even if they wanted to_ since Gab doesn't control the so-called "objectionable" content in question.
