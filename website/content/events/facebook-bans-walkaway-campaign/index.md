[Facebook](/facebook/) banned the [#WalkAway
Campaign](https://www.walkawaycampaign.com/about-more), as well as every one of
its team members, following [a hitpiece](https://archive.is/Wvuz8) being
published by ABC about the group. This move by Facebook came shortly after the
rioting at the US capitol.
