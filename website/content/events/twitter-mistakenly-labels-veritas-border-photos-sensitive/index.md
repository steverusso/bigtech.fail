Project Veritas released photos of migrant overflow cells at the U.S. border.
Twitter placed these behind a "potentially sensitive" warning overlay, and when
pressed on it, said it was an error. Allum Bokhari for Breitbart
[reported](https://archive.is/qhX33#selection-531.0-531.282):

> Twitter censored exclusive photos from Project Veritas showing thousands of
> immigrants sleeping on the floor in tight quarters at a Texas detention
> center, hiding the content behind a filter marked “potentially sensitive.”
> Twitter later reversed the censorship, calling it an error.
