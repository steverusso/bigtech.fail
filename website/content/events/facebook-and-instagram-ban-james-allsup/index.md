James Allsup's Instagram account (which had about 10k followers), his Facebook page, and his personal Facebook account were all deleted on Monday, August 12, 2019.

As James [explains in the video](https://www.bitchute.com/video/QIbKDUYtHDj4/), these bans do not line up with the claims of purging "politcally extreme" content since his Instagram account had almost no political content whatsoever.
He also says that he hadn't logged into his Facebook account for about two months.

However, why ban a totally normal Instagram account?
Well, it might be for _precisely_ that reason.
To paraphrase what James goes on to say in the video, people who have very different ideas but also present themselves as reasonable and calm people are "more of a political threat" than those who don't.
