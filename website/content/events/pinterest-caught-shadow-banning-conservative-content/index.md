Thanks to a Pinterest whistleblower, Project Veritas was able to obtain internal documents that showed the platform was shadow banning different types of conservative content.

The main takeaways from [the Project Veritas article](https://www.projectveritas.com/2019/06/11/tech-insider-blows-whistle-on-how-pinterest-listed-top-pro-life-site-as-porn-bible-verses-censored/) include:
* Search term "christian" won't autocomplete
* Search terms such as "bible verses" and "christian easter" are on the "Sensitive Terms List"
* Conservative websites including liveaction.org, zerohedge.com, pjmedia.com, and teaparty.org are on the "porn domain block list"
* Undercover Planned Parenthood videos are classified as "harmful" conspiracy

Definitely [check out the Project Veritas report](https://www.projectveritas.com/2019/06/11/tech-insider-blows-whistle-on-how-pinterest-listed-top-pro-life-site-as-porn-bible-verses-censored/) to see the documents, screenshots, and more.

In later developments, Pinterest [banned LiveAction](/events/pinterest-bans-live-action/) on the same day, June 11th, and [fired the whistleblower](/events/pinterest-fires-eric-cochran/) on June 19th.
