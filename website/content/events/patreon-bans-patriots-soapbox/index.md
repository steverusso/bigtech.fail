[Patreon](/patreon/) banned _Patriots' Soapbox News_ in an effort to purge
QAnon-related accounts shortly after Media Matters published an article titled
"Patreon is profiting from QAnon." The account had **62 patrons**.
> I'd also like to take this opportunity here to thank everyone that has

> You helped bigly in supporting month-to-month costs for us and many others,
> and I will not ever forget it.
>
> The fight goes on.
