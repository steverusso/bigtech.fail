Twitter suspended R. Clinton Ohlers, a contributing editor for Free Press Media
Group, shortly after he published [an article](https://archive.is/sGPyJ) on
WorldTribune.com regarding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine:
> My new piece on #HydroxyChloroquine. Strong evidence of its effectiveness was
> available since May, but buried in a major JAMA study.
>
> This got me banned on Twitter.
