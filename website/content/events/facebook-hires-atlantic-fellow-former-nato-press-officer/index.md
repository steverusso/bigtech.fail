Facebook hired former NATO press officer, current senior fellow at the Atlantic
Coucil, and current Russiagater [Ben
Nimmo](https://archive.is/2d7tw#selection-407.1-411.136) to be part of their
intelligence team:

> Next week, I’m starting at Facebook, where I’ll be helping to lead global
> threat intelligence strategy against influence operations.
>
> I’m very excited to join one of the best IO teams in the world to study,
> catch and get ahead of the known players and emerging threats.

Nimmo's pro-war career is riddled with falsely labeling anti-establishment
groups and individuals as "Russian bots", particularly when they speak out
against the interests of government intelligence agencies.
