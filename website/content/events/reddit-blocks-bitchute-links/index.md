Reddit started blocking any and all links to
[BitChute.com](https://bitchute.com/), a video hosting platform. One Reddit
user posted the notice that appeared after they tried to post a BitChute link.
It [began with](https://archive.is/woA8V#selection-2193.0-2193.186):

> Please be advised that Reddit removes all links to BitChute immediately upon
> submission. This policy comes from Reddit management, and community
> moderators are not able to override this.

BitChute [did not](https://archive.is/l003e) receive any notice from Reddit
regarding this matter.
