YouTube continued its policy of [purging any mention of Eric
Ciaramella](/e/facebook-youtube-purge-mentions-of-eric-ciaramella-as-alleged-whistleblower/)
by removing a video of Sen. Rand Paul saying the name in a speech on the Senate
floor. In the video, Sen. Paul reads the following question of his which was
blocked during the impeachment trial:
> Are you aware that House intelligence committee staffer Shawn Misko had a
> close relationship with Eric Ciaramella while at the National Security
> Council together and are you aware and how do you respond to reports that
> Ciaramella and Misko may have worked together to plot impeaching the
> President before there were formal house impeachment proceedings.

YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi [gave the following
statement](https://archive.vn/XTCWe#selection-1147.0-1147.369) to news outlets:
> Videos, comments, and other forms of content that mention the leaked
> whistleblower's name violate YouTube's Community Guidelines and will be
> removed from YouTube. We've removed hundreds of videos and over ten thousand
> comments that contained the name. Video uploaders have the option to edit
> their videos to exclude the name and reupload.

Sen. Paul responded in the following tweet:
> A chilling and disturbing day in America when giant web companies such as
> @YouTube decide to censor speech. Protected speech, such as that of a senator
> on the Sen floor, can be blocked from getting to the people. This is
> dangerous & politically biased. https://archive.vn/eSnM5
