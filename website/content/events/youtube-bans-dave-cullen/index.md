[YouTube](/youtube/) banned Dave Cullen of _Computing Forever_ after issuing
his channel its [third and final strike](https://archive.is/vvexd) for a video
that was published three months prior. The video, titled _This is a Spiritual
Battle_, is still available [on
BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/video/2gkUJk4dvaM/) and [on
Odysee](https://odysee.com/@ComputingForever:9/this-is-a-spiritual-battle:7).
His 14 year old channel had nearly **420k subscribers** and over **100 million
total views** across more than 1,800 videos.

> After 14 years, 500k subscribers and over 100 million views, my channel,
> Computing Forever has been deleted off YouTube. I knew it was coming. It's
> okay. I was always knew this time would come. I'm delighted to be part of a
> free speech, Alt-Tech revolution. I've developed platforms on Minds, Gab,
> Odysee and Bitchute and I'm excited at the prospect of a new beginning.
> Silicon Valley monopolies will be defeated. The people will be triumphant.
> Thank you all for your support, love and encouragement, you guys keep me
> going. I'm only just getting started. God Bless you all.

This happened about three weeks after [Cullen
announced](/events/dave-cullen-starts-leaving-youtube/) that he would no longer
be posting new content on YouTube.
