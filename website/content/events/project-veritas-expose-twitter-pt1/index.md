Project Veritas released a leaked video of Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey detailing
plans for more political censorship:

>
> “We are focused on one account [@realDonaldTrump] right now but this is going
> to be MUCH BIGGER than just one account & it’s going to go on for much
> longer..."
>
> #ExposeTwitter

About an hour after the release, Twitter marked the video as "potentially
sensitive content."
