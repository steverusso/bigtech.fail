Matt Christiansen released a video covering the
[highly-censored](/events/white-coat-summit/) "White Coat Summit." YouTube
promptly removed this video because it contained information and opinions that
contradicted the WHO.

Matt re-uploaded the video with all potential violations blurred and bleeped
out, and YouTube _still_ removed this video as well. Matt appealed this
removal, and the decision was upheld.
> Ridiculous.  My video was taken down AGAIN.  I will appeal this one.  Still

> YouTube has issued a final decision to ax my video.  Meanwhile, CNN can play
