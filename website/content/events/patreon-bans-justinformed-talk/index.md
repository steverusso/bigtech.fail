[Patreon](/patreon/) banned [_JustInformed
Talk_](https://justinformednews.com/), a political satire and opinionated
editorial review, in an effort to [purge QAnon-related](notice.png) accounts
shortly after Media Matters published an article titled "Patreon is profiting
from QAnon." The account had **520 patrons**.

> So Patreon deleted my account for content I create off their platform. Is the
