YouTube deleted James Allsup's channel, which had about 450k+ subscribers and no violations or strikes.
This comes exactly two weeks after he was [banned from Facebook and Instagram](/e/facebook-and-instagram-ban-james-allsup/).

> It's gone.
>
> Today YouTube decided to delete my channel without cause.
> I had no channel strikes, no violations, nothing- simply an email telling me that my livelihood, my means to exercise my political voice, my business I'd built over almost three years, was taken away from me.
>
> Please contact @TeamYouTube, @YTCreators, and @youtube and demand they reverse this egregious act of censorship.
> We will only get this done through mass action!
> They did it for Black Pigeon Speaks and I think there's an equally strong case here.
>
> I know it's not something we want to think about, but in the eventuality I do not get the channel back, this is going to be hugely disruptive for me (obviously.)
> If you appreciate my work, or have appreciated it over the years, and want to help me launch the Public Square Initiative or simply keep the lights on, I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart.
>
> Thank you all for your support.
