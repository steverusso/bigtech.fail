Twitch banned political commentator Nick Fuentes the day after he had [a
debate](http://archive.is/A3dpx) with several well-known content creators. In
[his live stream](https://www.bitchute.com/video/WRG2ygSTRl5Y/) the day after
being banned, Fuentes elaborates on how his channel was targeted and mass
reported:
> So they get mad that they lose the debate ... so naturally, what do they do?
> ... They go onto my Twitch channel ... and they raid my chat. And they're
> saying the N word, and they're saying all kinds of other things, ... so that
> they can report their own chat and say "Oh this guy's problematic, this guy's
> really got some hateful messaging in his show." So they get me kicked off of
> Twitch.

A few days later, Fuentes had great initial success on DLive (an alternative
streaming platform):
> My inaugural stream on DLive was the number two most watched stream on the
> whole site, behind only Pewdiepie. Twitch who???
