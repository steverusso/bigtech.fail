In early 2020, a Facebook vulnerability was exploited by a hacker or group of
hackers that allowed them to collect certain account data on over 500 million
users. (Facebook says this vulnerability has been patched.) In early 2021, the
hacker(s) established a database online that people could query for a fee. A
few months later, all of the data was published for free:

> All 533,000,000 Facebook records were just leaked for free.
>
> This means that if you have a Facebook account, it is extremely likely the
> phone number used for the account was leaked.
>
> I have yet to see Facebook acknowledging this absolute negligence of your
> data.

> Details include:
>
> Phone number, Facebook ID, Full name, Location, Past Location, Birthdate,
> (Sometimes) Email Address, Account Creation Date, Relationship Status, Bio.
>
> Bad actors will certainly use the information for social engineering,
> scamming, hacking and marketing.
