[Patreon](/patreon/) banned _SGTreport_ in an effort to purge QAnon-related
accounts shortly after Media Matters published an article titled "Patreon is
profiting from QAnon." The account had over **1k patrons**.

> So here's how @Patreon @PatreonSupport does it: They CHANGED THEIR POLICY
> TODAY concerning what THEY call "Qanon" accounts, and then TERMINATED
> accounts they say violate their NEW policy. Patreon needs to be sued for
> breaking the contract between me & more than 1,000 Patrons.
