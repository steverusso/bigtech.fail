From the [open letter](http://archive.is/0VAgS#selection-1169.470-1169.800)
that "Jarvis" wrote to Twitter:
> As I attempted to post a tweet, another message popped up, informing me that
> my account was indeed, banned. My fingers silenced. My thumbs impotent. I
> sunk to my knees and let out a raw, animalistic scream. The evenings spent at
> Wrightlyâ€™s Primeval Naturist Therapy Clinic had served me well, as the ground
> fair shook beneath me.
