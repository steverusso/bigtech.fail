As criticism grew of India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, the Indian
government (specifically the _Ministry of Electronics and Information
Technology_) asked social media companies to start censoring this criticism.
Twitter complied [according to _Geo
News_](https://archive.ph/aeQ8d#selection-729.0-741.298):

> A Twitter spokesperson also confirmed it received a valid legal request from
> the Indian government. "If the content violates Twitter's Rules, the content
> will be removed from the service. If it is determined to be illegal in a
> particular jurisdiction, but not in violation of the Twitter Rules, we may
> withhold access to the content in India only," said the Twitter official.
>
> [...]
>
> Acting on the complained, Twitter has removed more than 50 tweets that
> criticised the Indian government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The
> censored tweets and accounts include ones owned by a sitting member of
> India’s Parliament, two filmmakers, an actor, and a West Bengal state
> minister.

Facebook took similar action, particularly censoring the hashtag #ResignModi,
but it turns out this was just a mistake! _Times of India_
[reported](https://archive.ph/0dGqa#selection-1393.0-1397.232):

> Facebook said it barred the hashtag by mistake and not at the behest of the
> government, without elaborating. [...] The error stemmed from content
> associated with the label and not the hashtag itself, the spokesperson added.
