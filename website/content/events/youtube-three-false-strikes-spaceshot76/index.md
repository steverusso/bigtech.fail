[_Spaceshot76_](/profiles/spaceshot76/), a political commentary channel,
received [three false "impersonation" strikes on one single
video](three-bogus-strikes.jpg), all within a month, the final strike coming
**after the video was already removed** by YouTube. Speaking to BigTech.fail
about ten months later, _Spaceshot76_ summarized the situation:

> ...they flagged me three times for the same video, and said I was guilty of
> impersonation ... initially it was for bullying and harassment and I appealed
> and it was the only appeal Iâ€™d ever [won] through YouTube, then a week later
> they flagged the same video that they had already cleared and hit me for
> impersonation this time. ...another 10 or so days later I got flagged for the
> same exact video that was already removed...

The video in question is simply a 20 minute commentary on some current events
and [is still available on BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/video/zF3ZYj6scAo/).
