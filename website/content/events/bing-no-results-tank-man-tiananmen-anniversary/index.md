Bing showed no search results for "tank man" on the 23rd anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square Massacre, but this was just due to "accidental human error."
[_The Epoch Times_
reported](https://archive.ph/AoIrZ#selection-1085.0-1089.150):

> Microsoft on Friday said that its search engine Bing yielded no results when
> users entered the query “tank man” in the United States and elsewhere for
> part of Friday because of “accidental human error.”

The "error" was resolved a few hours later.
