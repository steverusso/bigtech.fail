YouTube "permanently disabled" _Press For Truth_, an independent
media channel run by Dan Dicks. His **14 year old channel** had about **272k
subscribers** and over **35 million lifetime views**, and it was removed
without any warning, guidelines strike, or explanation.

> 35m views, all gone, no warning, no email, nothing!!! Please message
> @TeamYouTube and help me get my channel, all those comments and supporters of

The last video he published on YouTube before being permanently banned was
titled **The WAYFAIR CONSPIRACY Is A PSYOP RED HERRING Designed To DISTRACT YOU
FROM THE TRUTH!!!** which can still be viewed [on
BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/video/93VJREXyewE/) and [on
Odysee](https://odysee.com/@PressForTruth:4/the-wayfair-conspiracy-is-a-psyop-red:8).

**About six months later** (and less than two days after Biden's inauguration),
YouTube reached out to Dan Dicks and said that this was a "mistake" and that
his channel would be reinstated. YouTube "reinstated" the channel, but they
gave it a strike for the last uploaded video without actually removing the
video. Dicks had to appeal this strike, which he won a few weeks later, and
then his channel was back to normal. In [a video
update](https://www.bitchute.com/video/Fc7IWyW3veQ/) regarding this reversal,
Dicks talked about how frustratingly unreliable YouTube has now become:

> To bring me back now is almost kind of frustrating to think that after 14
> years of putting so much effort into building up this platform, that I would
> just come back now because they just said "Here you go. Oops! Our mistake."
> and expect me to just build up this platform again, continue to bring in
> users, and what? All for them to take it all away again in a year from now?
