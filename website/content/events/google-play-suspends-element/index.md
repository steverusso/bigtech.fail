Google suspended _Element_, a decentralized and end-to-end encrypted messenging
app, [without warning or
notification](https://archive.is/xPXk6#selection-137.0-137.105). After an
initial appeal, the _Element_ team was told that the app was [removed to due
content that violated](https://archive.is/xPXk6#selection-137.106-137.324)
Google Play's Terms of Service. In a follow up appeal, _Element_ [explained
that the decentralized nature of their
app](https://archive.is/xPXk6#selection-141.68-141.332) means that they don't
have full control over network content that doesn't live on their servers:

> [...] Element is a generic chat app for connecting to the global Matrix
> communication network, just as Chrome is a generic web browser for connecting
> to the Web - and just as Google does not control the content on the Web,
> Element does not control the content on Matrix.

However, in this case, the content _was in fact_ on _Element_'s own servers,
and their own "Trust and Safety" team [had already taken action against this
content](https://archive.is/xPXk6#selection-213.32-213.546). Therefore, the app
was reinstated:

> [...] we received a call from a VP at Google who apologised for the bad
> communication from Google and explained the situation, which related to some
> extremely abusive content which was accessible on the default matrix.org
> homeserver. Our Trust and Safety team had already identified and acted on
> this content to enforce the server's terms of use, and so we've explained how
> Element and Matrix works, established a channel for communication over any
> future moderation concerns, and expect the app to be restored shortly.
