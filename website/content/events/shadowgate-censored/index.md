YouTube and Facebook deleted Millie Weaver's documentary _ShadowGate_ for
violating "hate speech" rules after it had been live for a couple of days
accumulating millions of views.
> YouTube just banned Millie Weaver's new #ShadowGate documentary, claiming it
> violates their policies against "hate speech." Twitter won't even let me post
> a link to where it was, claiming it leads to "harmful" content.

Twitter blocked all links to the documentary on YouTube (even after it was
removed) as well as censored the _#ShadowGate_ hashtag, actions which received
much less media attention than the video itself being removed on other
platforms.
> No conservative media outlets have reported that the hashtag #ShadowGate has
> been blocked by Twitter. Click on it, then click on "Latest." No results.
> It's been blocked.
>
> They're afraid to appear as they're supporting the documentary because Alex
> Jones funded it. [(image)](markdice-1296250739069554689.png)

_ShadowGate_ was even [removed from Banned.Video](https://archive.is/0vMl1), a
site that focuses on hosting highly censored videos. The documentary can still
be viewed in full [on Millie's website](https://www.millennialmillie.com) and
[on BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/m294VZFG6Kp1/).
