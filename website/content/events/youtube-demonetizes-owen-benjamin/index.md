YouTube completely demonetized Owen Benjamin. In the video he released about
this, he concludes by pointing out the fact that he had no strikes against his
channel:
> No strikes either. You know, people always complain about strikes. Zero
> strikes and then boom. And I was making them some coin, too. So, I hope this
> is a fun learning experience for everybody. Much love.
