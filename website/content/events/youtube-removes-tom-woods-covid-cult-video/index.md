YouTube removed a video from [_The Mises
Institute_](https://mises.org/), a non-profit that promotes Austrian economics
and freedom. The video, titled _The Covid Cult | Thomas E. Woods, Jr._,
accumulated **1.5 million views** before YouTube [removed it](notice.jpg)
without the possibility to appeal the decision. It [was the most successful
video](https://youtu.be/jEMk23dyWG4?t=507) of Tom Woods up until this point.
