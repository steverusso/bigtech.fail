A Facebook spokesperson
[confirmed](http://archive.is/C5owa#selection-867.1-867.207) that both Facebook
and Instagram banned The Proud Boys and several accounts linked to the
organization including its founder, [Gavin McInnes](/profiles/gavin-mcinnes/).

In a statement, Facebook [told TheWrap](http://archive.is/VVh6d#selection-595.319-595.487):
> We will continue to review content, Pages, and people that violate our
> policies, take action against hate speech and hate organizations to help keep
> our community safe.

As Breitbart [pointed out](http://archive.is/jtiub#selection-937.1-937.103),
these bans happened a week before the November 2018 midterm elections.
