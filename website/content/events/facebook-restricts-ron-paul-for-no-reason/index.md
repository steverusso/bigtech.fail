[Facebook](/facebook/) restricted Ron Paul from creating new pages and managing
his existing pages without citing a specific reason why. The notice on his
account said it was "Due to repeatedly going against [Facebook's] Community
Standards [...]", however, Ron Paul has never had any community standards
violations.

> With no explanation other than "repeatedly going against our community
> standards," @Facebook has blocked me from managing my page. Never have we
> received notice of violating community standards in the past and nowhere is
> the offending post identified.
