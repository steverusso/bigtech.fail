Facebook restricted Ron Paul from creating new pages and managing
his existing pages without citing a specific reason why. The notice on his
account said it was "Due to repeatedly going against [Facebook's] Community
Standards [...]", however, Ron Paul has never had any community standards
violations.

> With no explanation other than "repeatedly going against our community
> standards," @Facebook has blocked me from managing my page. Never have we

This move by Facebook came right aftr Ron Paul posted content that was critical
of tech censorship. Later that day, Facebook lifted the restrictions and said
in an email to _Reason_ that the restrictions were placed on his account in
"error." Two days later, Ron Paul [announced](https://archive.is/Olm9s) that
his content is now on **LBRY.tv** & **Odysee**!
