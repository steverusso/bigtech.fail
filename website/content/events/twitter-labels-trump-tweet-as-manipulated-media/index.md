Twitter labeled a tweet from Pres. Trump as "manipulated media." It contained a
video by meme creator @CarpeDonktum which the New York Post [describes the
video](http://archive.is/HlHqq#selection-1255.0-1267.73) pretty well as
follows:
> In the video Trump shared with his 80 million followers, the clip was edited
> to show one of the tots, who is white, running after the other child, who is
> black, with a fake CNN headline that read: "Terrified toddler runs from
> racist baby."
>
> "Racist baby probably a Trump voter," a subsequent headline reads.
>
> The clip then goes on to say: "America is not the problem. Fake news is."

Twitter later honored a DMCA request to take the video down entirely, so it is
no longer even available to watch within the original tweet. However, it is
available to view as the first video in [this
compilation](https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1122612088517787648) that
CarpeDonktum uploaded to Minds.

Twitter [permanently banned](/events/twitter-bans-carpedonktum/) the video
creater a week later.
