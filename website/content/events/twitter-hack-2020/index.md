On July 15, 2020, many high-profile, verified Twitter accounts sent out tweets
that lured people into a cryptocurrency scam. These accounts included
individuals such as Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, and even the official
account for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. The gist of these tweets was
something like "I'm feeling generous. Send x amount of Bitcoin to this address
and I'll send 2x back."

As it turned out, this was the concluding segment of a major Twitter hack that
compromised 130 accounts in total. According to @TwitterSupport's updates, [45
of those accounts](https://archive.ph/OwzZP#selection-941.1-941.240) sent out
cryptocurrency scam tweets, [36 of the
accounts](https://archive.ph/OwzZP#selection-1085.1-1085.250) had their direct
message inbox accessed, and [8 of the
accounts](https://archive.ph/OwzZP#selection-981.1-981.249) had all of their
data downloaded using Twitter's "Your Twitter Data" tool:

> As of now, we know that they accessed tools only available to our internal
> support teams to target 130 Twitter accounts. For 45 of those accounts, the
> attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and
> send Tweets.

> For up to eight of the Twitter accounts involved, the attackers took the
> additional step of downloading the account’s information through our “Your
> Twitter Data” tool. We are reaching out directly to any account owner where
> we know this to be true.

> We believe that for up to 36 of the 130 targeted accounts, the attackers
> accessed the DM inbox, including 1 elected official in the Netherlands. To
> date, we have no indication that any other former or current elected official
> had their DMs accessed.

About two weeks later, [three individuals were
charged](https://archive.ph/i7kO1#selection-625.0-633.347) by the U.S.
government, and Twitter [issued an
update](https://archive.ph/nYB4E#selection-505.0-505.648) that provided more
information as to how the attack was actually conducted:

> The social engineering that occurred on July 15, 2020, targeted a small
> number of employees through a phone spear phishing attack. A successful
> attack required the attackers to obtain access to both our internal network
> as well as  specific employee credentials that granted them access to our
> internal support tools. Not all of the employees that were initially targeted
> had permissions to use account management tools, but the attackers used their
> credentials to access our internal systems and gain information about our
> processes. This knowledge then enabled them to target additional employees
> who did have access to our account support tools.

As a side note, right as the hack was being discovered on July 15, [there was
an image that was leaked](https://archive.ph/tQ24D#selection-1069.0-1091.74)
that appeared to be a screenshot of a Twitter admin dashboard, and a button to
'blacklist' trends was visible in the screenshot. [Twitter removed the
image](https://archive.is/235Hy#selection-979.0-979.146) and suspended a few
accounts who shared it, likely because the image contained personal information
that was not redacted.

> Twitter has time and resources to censor and shadow ban conservatives 
>
> Meanwhile the entire site is taken over. Probably every DM is in a third
> party database now. 
>
> And this is only months after Saudi spies hired twitter employees to arrest
> dissidents.
