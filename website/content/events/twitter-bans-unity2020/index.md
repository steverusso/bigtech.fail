Twitter [banned _Unity2020_](https://archive.ph/n9YCa#selection-453.0-457.164)
(@ArticlesOfUnity) :clown: [for "using automated
bots."](https://archive.ph/VYq3O#selection-457.2-457.83) Additionally, Twitter
prevented users from even posting the link to the Unity2020 website:

> Thursday night, Articles of Unity supporters began trending globally on
> Twitter by using the hashtag #JustSayNoToDonaldAndJoe during Donald Trump’s
> RNC speech.
>
> Then, yesterday, Twitter suspended the Articles of Unity account
> indefinitely. What’s worse, they have banned users from even sharing a link
> to ArticlesOfUnity.org.
