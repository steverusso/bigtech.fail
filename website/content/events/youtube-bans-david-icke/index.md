YouTube banned David Icke _only one day before_ Rose/Icke III was set to air.
Icke's 14 year old channel had about 900k subscribers, more than 1k videos, and **NO STRIKES** against it.

This YouTube ban came about a day after [Facebook banned him](/e/facebook-bans-david-icke/) and less than a month after the whole [Rose/Icke II](/e/youtube-removes-rose-icke-ii/) controversy.

Brian Rose from London Real released [a short vlog](https://www.bitchute.com/video/Fdot9l3yi98/) regarding Icke's YouTube ban in which he described the dystopian path we are on:
> And your phone's going to be tracking you everywhere.
> And you're going to have points scoring how good or bad you've been.
> And your rights are going to be taken away accordingly.
> And that's where we're going.
> And it might sound crazy to you, but it's happening.
