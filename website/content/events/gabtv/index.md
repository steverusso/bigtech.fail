Andrew Torba, the CEO of Gab, announced the launch of a new alternative YouTube
platform called [GabTV](https://tv.gab.com/):

> Today Gab is excited to announce the launch of GabTV, a free speech video
> sharing platform. GabTV offers The People an alternative to tyrannical Big
> Tech platforms and legacy media outlets that have been working to silence any
> and all dissent from the “approved” narratives of the establishment
> oligarchs.

Torba also touched on the business model of GabTV and how the company intends
to respect users' privacy (much unlike YouTube):

> Our goal is to provide a platform for content of the highest quality from the
> best independent creators on the internet. Our business model is to sell our
> valuable video hosting and distribution service to creators rather than
> track, censor, and data-mine users like our competitors.
