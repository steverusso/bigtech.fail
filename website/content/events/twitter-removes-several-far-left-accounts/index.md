Twitter banned several far left / Antifa accounts the day after
far left groups protested Biden's inauguration and attacked the Democratic
Party headquarters in Portland, Oregon.

> Breaking: @Twitter has suspended several prominent #antifa accounts.
> @TheBaseBK is one of them. The Base is an extremist bookstore in Brooklyn, NY
> that has been used as an antifa training center.
