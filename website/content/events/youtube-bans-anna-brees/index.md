[YouTube](/youtube/) banned Anna Brees, an independent journalist, due to a
video that was published three months prior which violated YouTube's policy on
not contradicting health "authorities." The video (still available [on
BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/video/lRJt4Cw4lC8/)) is simply Brees
reporting on and covering a COVID lockdown protest in Britain. Her channel was
five and half years old and had more than **67k subscribers** and **3.1 million
total views** over about 440 videos.
