YouTube banned [Rachel Reenstra](https://rachelreenstra.net) after she uploaded
[a preview of an
interview](https://odysee.com/@loveyourwildlife:d/when-irish-eyes-are-not-smiling-ireland:6)
she did with someone from Ireland talking about the COVID-19 lockdowns and
vaccines:

> The censorship is getting real! Take control of your right to freedom of
> speech and follow me on the best new platform out there right now -Youtube
> removed my channel for a video about immunity and health- and you think this
> is normal? #WakeUp #censorship
>
> -- Rachel Reenstra (@Rachelreenstra) [24 Feb 2021](https://archive.is/dKa9r)

Her main channel contained all 24 years of her professional work which was
luckily [backed up on Odysee](https://odysee.com/@loveyourwildlife:d). Her
second channel was deleted a couple weeks later after she uploaded the clip of
Wendy Williams saying she is not getting a covid vaccine because she doesn't
trust it.

Rachel Reenstra is on [alternative video-hosting](/alt/video-hosting/)
platforms, primarily [BrandNewTube](https://brandnewtube.com/@RachelReenstra),
but she's also [on Odysee](https://odysee.com/@RachelReenstra:6) and [on
Rumble](https://rumble.com/user/RachelReenstra).
