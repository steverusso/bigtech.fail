Facebook deleted Jordan Sather's personal Facebook account as well his
_Destroying the Illusion_ page and _Destroying the Illusion_ group two days
after his YouTube channel [was
deleted](/events/youtube-bans-destroying-the-illusion/):
> Discord removed my account and my server last night, then this morning
> Facebook suspended my account I had on there. I had 45K followers on my

> DTI that had about 12K people in it. I received NO warning, message or email
> about being removed from Facebook, or reason for why they did it.
