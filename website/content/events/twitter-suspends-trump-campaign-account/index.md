Twitter suspended the official Trump campaign account (@TeamTrump) for posting
a video saying that "Joe Biden is a liar who has been ripping off our country
for years." Twitter [claimed](notice.jpg) that the video violated Twitter's
rules against "posting private information." However, the Trump campaign put
the video right back up once the account was unsuspended:
> We are back and we are re-posting the video Twitter doesn’t want you to
> watch.
>
> JOE BIDEN IS A LIAR WHO HAS BEEN RIPPING OFF OUR COUNTRY FOR YEARS!
>
> PASS IT ON.
