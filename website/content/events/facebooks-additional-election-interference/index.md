Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg detailed 11 additional steps that the company
will be taking (in regards to the 2020 US presidential election)
[to](https://archive.is/0bIXK#selection-691.67-691.160) "encourage voting,
connect people with authoritative information, and fight misinformation." These
steps included a continued crackdown on "conspiracy networks" like QAnon as
well as a blanket ban on all political ads in the week leading up to the
election.

However, there was also this little gem about how Facebook will deal with
anyone questioning the legitimacy of the election:
> We will attach an informational label to content that seeks to delegitimize
> the outcome of the election or discuss the legitimacy of voting methods, for
> example, by claiming that lawful methods of voting will lead to fraud. This
> label will provide basic authoritative information about the integrity of the
> election and voting methods.
