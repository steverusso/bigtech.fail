YouTube banned Patrick Coffin, host of _Patrick Coffin Media_, for a
months-old, unlisted video. This ended up being the channel's "third strike,"
although it seemed to be well outside of the 90-day period established in
YouTube's three strike policy:

> My channel was terminated by YouTube on March 31. The video that got the
> strike was an "unlisted" video from October 2020. I filed an appeal because I
> believe this is an error and we didn't violate the Guidelines. My content is
> on faith and culture and helps many. Retweet/comment
