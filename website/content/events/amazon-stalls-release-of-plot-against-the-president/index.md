Amazon stalled the release of a documentary titled _The Plot Against the
President_ which details the efforts of the Democrat party to undermine Trump's
presidency after the election. [Breitbart
reported](https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/10/22/amazon-held-back-release-of-plot-against-the-president-said-documentary-needed-content-review/):

> With less than a month to go before the election, Amazon held back the
> release of the Amanda Milius documentary The Plot Against the President for
> almost two weeks [...] Amazon finally released the movie on Thursday — 12
> days after it was first submitted — after a journalist from The Hollywood
> Reporter inquired about the hold up. [...] Normally, Amazon takes between two
> to four days to process a movie submission, according to Cory Tucek,
> president and CEO of Turn Key Films, which is distributing the documentary.

The documentary's official Twitter account was
[banned](/e/twitter-bans-the-plot-against-the-president/) about a month
later along with the accounts of several of its crew members.
