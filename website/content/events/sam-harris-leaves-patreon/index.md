After Patreon banned several members for wrongthink, Sam Harris decided to protect himself and his funding by deleting his Patreon account.

From [his letter](leaving-patreon-letter.jpg): "...I consider it no longer tenable to expose any part of my podcast funding to the whims of Patreon's "Trust and Safety" committee."
