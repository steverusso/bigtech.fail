Dave Cullen officially [started leaving
YouTube](/e/dave-cullen-starts-leaving-youtube/) in December of 2020 following
a year in which nearly a dozen of his videos were removed. He was [banned from
YouTube](/e/youtube-bans-dave-cullen/) about about three weeks after that.
Luckily, he had been building his presence on alternative platforms the whole
time.
