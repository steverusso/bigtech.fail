Facebook "unpublished" the _Press For Truth_ page, run by Dan Dicks, for
"misleading behavior" or "violating the Facebook spam policies." This happened
on the same day that [Facebook
removed](http://archive.is/DWiWY#selection-1773.0-1773.139) over 800 pages and
accounts for violations "against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior."
