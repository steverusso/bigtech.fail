Early in the day on April 20, CNN activist Donie O'Sullivan [tweeted
out](https://archive.vn/I6CxA) that Facebook "removed promotion of
anti-quarantine events in California, New Jersey, and Nebraska after
consultation with state governments", which was followed by fellow CNN activist
Oliver Darcy [tweeting out](https://archive.vn/RVXlB) that protest groups "are
being removed from the platform on the instruction of governments." These
claims were based on what [a Facebook spokesperson told
CNN](https://archive.vn/pLndl#selection-1427.105-1427.144).

As it turned out, this was mostly, if not entirely, false. The phrases
"consultation with state governments" and "on the instruction of governments"
might make it seem like the governments _consulted with_ or _instructed_
Facebook in regards to removing anit-lockdown protest groups... but they
didn't.

Nebraska's governor's office [issued the following statement](https://archive.vn/xuPSv#selection-547.0-561.373):
> The Governor's Office is not aware of any Facebook events regarding COVID-19
> protests, and has not requested Facebook to pull any events down. Facebook
> reached out last week to learn more about Nebraskaâ€™s social distancing
> restrictions, and the Governor's staff provided already publicly available
> information about Nebraska's ten-person limit and Directed Health Measures.

And New Jersey's governor's office [issued the following statement](https://archive.vn/xuPSv#selection-567.0-571.171):
> The governor's office did not ask Facebook to remove pages or posts for
> events promoting lifting the provisions of the governor's stay-at-home order.

It seems most likely that Facebook alone made the decision to remove certain
event pages since the CEO Mark Zuckerberg [told
ABC](https://archive.vn/WQr7f#selection-1661.0-1729.138) that anti-lockdown
protests count as "harmful misinformation" and will therefore be taken down.

Later in the day, a Facebook spokesperson [told Breitbart](https://archive.vn/xuPSv#selection-961.1-961.254):
> Unless government prohibits the event during this time, we allow it to be
> organized on Facebook. For this same reason, events that defy government's
> guidance on social distancing aren't allowed on Facebook.
