Google removed a third-party [BitChute](/alttech/bitchute/) app (by
a developer named _Hexagod_) from the Play Store claiming that it violated the
"Webviews and Affiliate Spam Policy." The app had **220k installations** before
it was removed.

One of the reasons Google gave for the removal was that the corporation does
not allow apps that "drive affiliate traffic to a website ... without the
permission from the website owner or administrator." BitChute responded to this
claim with the following:

> The Bitchute app by @VybeyPantelonez has been suspended from Googles
> Playstore. Contrary to the message below there was never any affiliate deal
> and permission was given
