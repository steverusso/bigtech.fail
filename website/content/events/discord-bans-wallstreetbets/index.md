Discord banned the official server for the **r/wallstreetbets** sub-reddit for
"hate speech" violations and "spreading misinformation" just as the group was
experiencing exponential growth and using their coordinated buying power to
cause tens of billions of dollars in losses for hedge funds who had short
positions in stocks like GameStop.

Discord gave [the following statement](https://archive.is/EaRcR) to Rod Breslau
(**@Slasher** on Twitter):

> The server has been on our Trust & Safety team's radar for some time due to
> occasional content that violates our Community Guidelines, including hate
> speech, glorifying violence, and spreading misinformation. Over the past few
> months, we have issued multiple warnings to the server admin.
>
> Today, we decided to remove the server and its owner from Discord for
> continuing to allow hateful and discriminatory content after repeated
> warnings.
>
> To be clear, we did not ban this server due to financial fraud related to
> GameStop or other stocks. Discord welcomes a broad variety of personal
> finance discussions from investment clubs and day traders to college students
> and professional financial advisors. We are monitoring this situation and in
> the event there are allegations of illegal activities, we will cooperate with
> the authorities as appropriate.
