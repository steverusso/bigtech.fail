[Patreon](/patreon/) banned [_InTheMatrixxx_](https://inthematrixxx.com/), an
independent media outlet, in an effort to purge QAnon-related accounts shortly
after Media Matters published an article titled "Patreon is profiting from
QAnon." The account had **369 patrons**.

> Here is my message to @Patreon regarding the decision to deactivate our
> Patreon account.
>
> I would ask Patreon what exactly is disinfo. 
>
> “Simply mentioning, entertaining, reporting on, or debunking QAnon is not a
> violation of our guidelines.”
