Media analyist Mark Dice posted a video on Facebook of [Kyle
Rittenhouse](/context/kyle-rittenhouse/) helping an injured protestor in
Kenosha, WI. Facebook removed this post, gave Mark a community guidelines
strike, and restricted his page since Facebook deemed this as "praise" or
"support" for someone on their "dangerous individuals" list:

> We don't allow symbols, praise or support of dangerous individuals or
> organizations on Facebook.

Mark responded with the following on Twitter:

> In no way did I "glorify" or celebrate him, nor "praise" him. I simply posted
> a non-graphic video, and stated as a matter of fact what it showed.  He
> helped a protester who was injured and didn't show up in Kenosha with any
> malicious intent to cause trouble.
