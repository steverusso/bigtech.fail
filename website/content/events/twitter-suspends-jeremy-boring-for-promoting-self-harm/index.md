Twitter suspended Daily Wire co-founder Jeremy Boreing for "promoting or
encouraging suicide or self-harm." In repsonse to a recipe posted by Daily Wire
reporter Emily Zanotti, Boreing jokingly tweeted the following:
> Even better, coat with melted butter, salt, pepper, a dash of paprika, and a
> dash of Worcestershire, sear in cast iron in bacon grease for thirty seconds
> or until brown, then throw them away and burn your face off with the hot pan
> because even that would be better than Brussels sprouts.

He was reinstated a few hours later.
