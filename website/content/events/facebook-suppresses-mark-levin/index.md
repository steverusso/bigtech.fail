> Facebook has just sent us this message. It’s a clear effort at censorship.
> Every link I post is from a legitimate source. But because so many people are

> that Facebook is trying to influence the election’s outcome. It’s also clear
> Facebook is pushing a leftwing agenda. I’ll address this tonight on radio.
