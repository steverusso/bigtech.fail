Facebook banned Marq Andrew Speck, the lead singer of a Christian rock band,
after falsely associating him and his pages with QAnon likely due to the fact
his nickname is 'Q.' Below is [an excerpt from a
post](https://archive.is/ggUEh#selection-1755.1-1767.122) he made detailing the
removal of personal account and **eight** of his pages that occurred without
warning or explanation:

>  For over 40 years, my family, friends, fans and followers from around the
>  world have known me by my nickname “Q” which is prominent in my personal
>  music logo, merchandise and multiple websites around the Internet.
>
>  I have been a Facebook user – both personally and professionally with
>  various music, user groups and business pages – for over a decade.
>
>  On Monday, October 19, 2020, I logged on to find that 7 of my 9 Facebook
>  pages had been taken down (“disabled”) and my role as Administrator on my
>  other 2 cancelled. When researching how and why this happened, I received a
>  terse and rather ominous pop-up from Facebook stating:
>
>  “Your Facebook account was disabled because it did not follow our Community
>  Standards. This decision can’t be reversed.” 

Speck [went on to mention](https://archive.is/ggUEh#selection-1863.1-1867.96)
the fruitless attempt to get Facebook's Oversight Board to rectify the
situation:

> I did try submitting my case to your new Oversight Board
> (https://www.oversightboard.com/) but it just returned me to the
> “Disabled/Unable To Review” message. Complete runaround so far.

Speck's personal account and most of his pages seem to have been reinstated.
