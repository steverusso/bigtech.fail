BitSlide, an unofficial Android app for the video hosting platform
[BitChute](/alttech/bitchute/), was removed from the [Google](/google/) Play
Store [for violating](notice.png) Google's "User Generated Content" policy. At
the time of this writing, at least one of the offending videos cited by Google
has been available for over a year on [YouTube](/youtube/), a video publishing
site owned by Google, without so much as an adult content notice.

BitSlide considered several solutions in order to get the app reinstated,
including [removing the entire category of videos](https://archive.is/2MDvo)
that Google complained about. However,
[Styxhexenhammer666](/profiles/styxhexenhammer666/) (the largest BitChute user
at the time) [pointed out](https://archive.is/C9i52#selection-865.8-865.262)
what what Google was really up to and offered the only viable solution:

> [...] after explicitly searching that category I could not find anything
> obscene there. Google downed your app for political reasons and is extremely
> unlikely to restore it regardless of what you do.
>
> Clone the code, make a new app, ask creators to promote it.

The APK file (which is essentially an Android app in a file) was made available
for "side-loading" (a method of app installation that does not involve a
trusted third party such as the app store). BitChute hosted the APK which is
available for download [here](https://app.bitchute.com/bitslide/).
