[YouTube](/youtube/) announced via a blog post that they would be removing
content that alleges "that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of
the 2020 U.S. Presidential election." An excerpt from the blog post
[reads](https://archive.is/LppDR#selection-1203.0-1203.450):

> Yesterday was the safe harbor deadline for the U.S. Presidential election and
> enough states have certified their election results to determine a
> President-elect. Given that, we will start removing any piece of content
> uploaded today (or anytime after) that misleads people by alleging that
> widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Presidential
> election, in line with our approach towards historical U.S. Presidential
> elections.
