In the video, Dr. Paul was critical of Trump's main COVID adviser, Anthony
Fauci:

> But you know what? I'm just wondering, we've sort of been annoyed by Fauci
> for a long time, so it's not new for us. People are starting to wonder, "Is
> this guy really a genius?" That's because, you know, he is symbolic of the
> shutdown, and people are getting disgusted with it.

He went on to show the clip of the Trump rally where the people chanted "Fire
Fauci!" The full episode, titled _'Fire Fauci!' - Trump Rally Explodes Over
Coronavirus Doom And Gloomer_, is still available [on
