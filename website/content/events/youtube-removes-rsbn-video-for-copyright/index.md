YouTube removed _an 8 hour long_ video published by the Right Side Broadcasting
Networking because it contained _a 16 second portion_ of copyrighted music:
> Yes, our almost 8 hour YouTube video of today’s events at Mount Rushmore has
> been blocked from being viewed due to 16 seconds of a copyrighted song that
> leaked through after Trump’s speech.
>
> We had 1.2 million total views on it.
>
> Trying to resolve, will update.
