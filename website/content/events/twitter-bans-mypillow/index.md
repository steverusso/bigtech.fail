Twitter banned the corporate account for MyPillow three weeks after [banning
the CEO, Mike Lindell](/e/twitter-bans-mike-lindell/), claiming that
Lindell operating this account violated their policies against evading
permanent bans. [Breitbart
reported](https://archive.is/ks6Hf#selection-625.149-629.134):

> Lindell took the MyPillow account to post a tweet on Sunday which read: “Jack
> Dorsey is trying to cancel me (Mike Lindell) out! Jack will be found out and
> should be put in prison when all is revealed!” Lindell was banned from the
> platform last week, and now Jack Dorsey and Twitter are using that as an
> excuse to shut down the account of his corporation.
