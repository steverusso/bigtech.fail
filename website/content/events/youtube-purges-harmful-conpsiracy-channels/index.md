In a blog post, [YouTube](/youtube/) bragged about how many conspiracy channels
and videos had been removed up until this point, and then
[announced](https://archive.is/XAtuq#selection-1163.0-1171.307) the further
purge of channels they deemed to be spreading "harmful conspiracy theories":

> Today we're further expanding both our hate and harassment policies to
> prohibit content that targets an individual or group with conspiracy theories
> that have been used to justify real-world violence. One example would be
> content that threatens or harrasses someone by suggesting they are complicit
> in  one of these harmful conspiracies, such as QAnon or Pizzagate.

This occurred _the very next day_ after the _New York Post_ published its
expos√© on Hunter Biden resulting in Twitter and Facebook taking action to
suppress its reach.

Below are just the channels we were able to identify as part of this purge,
listed in order of subscriber count. One week later, many of these same
accounts were suddenly [banned from
Patreon](/e/patreon-announces-qanon-purge/) as well.
