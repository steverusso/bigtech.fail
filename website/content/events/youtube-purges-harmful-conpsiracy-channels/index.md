In a blog post, [YouTube](/youtube/) bragged about how many conspiracy channels
and videos had been removed up until this point, and then
[announced](https://archive.is/XAtuq#selection-1163.0-1171.307) the further
purge of channels they deemed to be spreading "harmful conspiracy theories":

> Today we're further expanding both our hate and harassment policies to
> prohibit content that targets an individual or group with conspiracy theories
> that have been used to justify real-world violence. One example would be
> content that threatens or harrasses someone by suggesting they are complicit
> in  one of these harmful conspiracies, such as QAnon or Pizzagate.
