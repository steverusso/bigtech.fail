In July 2017, a software engineer at Google named James Demore authored an internal memo titled ["Google's Ideological Echo Chamber."](https://www.dhillonlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Damore-Google-Manifesto.pdf)
In it, Demore talks about the gender gap that currently exists in tech, differences between men and women that could possibly account for this gap, and logical ways to go about bringing more women into tech.

He also warns that Google has an atmosphere that is highly averse to different ideas saying: **"My larger point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don't fit a certain ideology."**

Well, this memo so triggered the higher ups at Google that they decided to go ahead and prove James's point by firing him for ~~wrongthink~~ ["violating the code of conduct."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%27s_Ideological_Echo_Chamber)

Luckily, this got a lot of media attention (for a little while), and James was able to get his message out by having conversations with several prominent internet figures including [Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ1JeII0eGo), [Dave Rubin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NOSD0XK0r8), and [Jordan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEDuVF7kiPU).
