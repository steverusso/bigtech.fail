About a week after Jones was [banned from several major platforms](/events/alex-jones-mass-banned/), Twitter temporarily suspended him.

[According to Vijaya Gadde](https://youtu.be/K-6n46X__WQ?t=298) (lead of Trust and Safety, Legal, and Public Policy at Twitter), the violation was the following line (from a video) which Twitter interpreted as "a call to violence against the media":

> So people need to have their battle rifles ready, and everything ready, at their bedsides, and you've gotta be ready, because the media is so disciplined in their deception.
