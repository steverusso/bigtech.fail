About a week after Jones was [banned from several major
platforms](/events/alex-jones-mass-banned/), Twitter temporarily suspended him.

[According to Vijaya Gadde](https://youtu.be/K-6n46X__WQ?t=298) (lead of Trust
and Safety, Legal, and Public Policy at Twitter), the violation was the
following line (from a video) which Twitter interpreted as "a call to violence
against the media":
> So people need to have their battle rifles ready, and everything ready, at
> their bedsides, and you've gotta be ready, because the media is so
> disciplined in their deception.
