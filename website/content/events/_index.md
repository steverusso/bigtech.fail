title: All Events
---

The main purpose of an Event in this context is to provide evidence that
something happened on a certain date. In other words, Events should be thought
of more as living records and _not_ as news reports. By extension, this page is
meant to be a collection of records in the form of a timeline and _not_ a news
feed. (Generally speaking, it will lag behind the news by about a week or so).
