Styxhexenhammer666, aka. "Styx", became the **first user on BitChute to reach
100k subscribers**. In his video regarding this achievement, he once again
encouraged all content creators to, in some capacity, start using AltTech:
> I hope people realize this: if you're a content creator, an independent
> creator, and you are not taking AltTech seriously, your're missing out. ...
> Just have a placeholder there. If you want to take the "wait and see"
> attitude, and just put your foot in the door and leave it there, you can do
> that. If you want to do what I'm doing, make exclusives, become the biggest
> user on one of these sites, you can do that, too.
