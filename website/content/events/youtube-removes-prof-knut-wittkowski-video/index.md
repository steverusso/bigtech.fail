YouTube removed a video featuring Prof. Knut Wittkowski, the former head of biostatistics, epidemiology and research design at Rockefeller University.
The video was produced by Journeyman Pictures and published on April 3, 2020 as the second episode in a series titled "Perspectives on the Pandemic."
The video had received approximately 1.3 million views before it was taken down.
Wittkowski [told the NY Post](https://archive.vn/byHS2#selection-1227.1-1227.154):
> They don't tell you. They just say it violates our community standards.
> There's no explanation for what those standards are or what standards it violated.

The video was likely removed because Wittkowski voiced opinions that [contradict the recommendations of the World Health Organization](/events/youtube-says-contradicting-who-will-violate-guidelines/).
About two minutes into the video, he says:
> With all respiratory diseases, the only thing that stops the disease is herd
> immunity.  About 80% of the people need to have had contact with the virus,
> and the majority of them won't even have recognized that they were infected,
> or they had very, very mild symptoms, especially if they are children.

Of course, as usual, the video is available on AltTech:
