YouTube whipped out a new level of corporate pandering on Thanksgiving Day by

> For Indigenous and Native Americans, the fourth Thursday of November is
> dedicated to Indigenous history, activism, and resistance. It’s called
> Unthanksgiving.
>
> Unthanksgiving is about acknowledging, educating, and honoring centuries of
> Indigenous resistance. Coinciding with New England’s National Day of
> Mourning, Unthanksgiving activates Alcatraz Island, the site of a 19-month
> occupation by Bay Area Natives in 1969.
