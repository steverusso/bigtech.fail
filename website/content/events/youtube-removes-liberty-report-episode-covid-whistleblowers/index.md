YouTube removed an episode of the Ron Paul Liberty Report which covered
information from two whistleblowers that exposed highly questionable COVID-19
testing procedures. Additionally, the channel received a warning.

In the beginning of the video (still available [on
BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/video/7NQZK3b4Ezhe/)), Dr. Paul mentions how
free expression is being undermined by social media censorship:

> I've always considered the principle of the first amendment as so crucial, as
> being allowed to talk and express ourselves, and of course, I always thought
> the internet would be our bosom buddies on this, and yet we can get
> blackballed on social media, too.

YouTube [removed another
episode](/events/youtube-removes-another-liberty-report-for-medical-misinfo/),
which among other things was critical of Fauci, about three months later.
