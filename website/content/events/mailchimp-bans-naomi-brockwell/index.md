Mailchimp banned [Naomi Brockwell](https://naomibrockwell.com/), an independent
journalist and producer who publishes a newsletter called _Cryptobeat_, a
weekly summary of "all the biggest crypto news in under 5 minutes." Mailchimp
told Brockwell "the content associated with your industry conflicts with our
Acceptable Use Policy."

> Oh wow, my newsletter account was just terminated. Thanks, @Mailchimp.
