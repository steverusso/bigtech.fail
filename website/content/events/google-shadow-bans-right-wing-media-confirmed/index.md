Leading up to the 2020 election, right-wing media outlets started claiming that
their sites were being heavily shadow banned in Google search. _Breitbart_, for
example, [reported the
following](https://archive.is/fjp1K#selection-585.103-595.168) in July of 2020:

> New data shows that Google has suppressed Breitbart’s search visibility by
> 99.7 percent since 2016.
>
> On April 4, 2016, Breitbart ranked in the top ten search positions (i.e., on
> the first page of Google search results) for 355 key search terms; but now,
> as of July 20, 2020, Breitbart ranks in the top ten search positions for only
> one search term. And, on April 4, 2016, Breitbart ranked in the top 100
> search positions for 16,820 key search terms; but now, as of July 20, 2020,
> Breitbart ranks in the top 100 search positions for only 55 search terms.
>
> Moreover, organic Google search traffic to Breitbart (measured by unique
> visitors) is down 63 percent when comparing the first half of 2016 with the
> first half of 2020.

Other right-wing / conservative media outlets such as _The Daily Caller_
[reported similar things](https://archive.is/30w6g) happening around the same
time. A few months later, on September 20, 2020, _RealClearPolitics_
[confirmed](https://archive.is/IWwh1#selection-1437.0-1437.353) these claims in
a very thorough report titled [_Google Pushes Conservative News Sites Far Down
Search
Lists_](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/09/20/google_pushes_conservative_news_sites_far_down_search_lists_144246.html):

> It has long been feared that Google, which controls almost 90% of U.S.
> Internet search traffic, could sway an election by altering the search
> results it shows users. New data indicate that may be happening, as
> conservative news sites including Breitbart, the Daily Caller, and the
> Federalist have seen their Google search listings dramatically reduced.

About a month later, this was still happening, as _Breitbart_
[reported](https://archive.is/ePYvx#selection-1035.0-1035.275) that a news
article wouldn't even appear in the Google search results _even if searched for
by the precise title of the article itself_:

> It appears that Breitbart News links are being hidden on Google searches even
> when users search for the exact string of words in an original Breitbart
> headline. When links to Breitbart stories do appear, it is often below
> obscure websites that plagiarize Breitbart’s content.
