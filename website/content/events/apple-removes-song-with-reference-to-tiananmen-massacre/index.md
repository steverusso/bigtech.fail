Less than two months before the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square
Massacre, Apple removed a song that made a reference to it from Apple Music in
China. The Hong Kong Free Press
[reported](https://archive.is/g04th#selection-1893.0-1897.140):

> The song, the title of which translates to “The Path of Man,” was the theme
> music of the 1990 film A Chinese Ghost Story II. According to the late James
> Wong, who penned the lyrics, parts of the song were directly referring to the
> 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
>
> “The youth are angry, heaven and earth are weeping… How did our land become a
> sea of blood? How did the path home become a path of no return?” the lyrics
> read.

This happened about a week after nearly all songs by pro-democracy protesters
Anthony Wong and Denise Ho were also removed from Apple Music in China while
remaining available in the Hong Kong, Taiwan, and North America regions.
