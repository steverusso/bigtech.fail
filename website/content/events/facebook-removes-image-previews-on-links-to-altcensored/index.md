Facebook removed the image previews for all links to [altCensored.com](https://altcensored.com/), a community catalog of removed or limited-state videos on YouTube.
This came about a week after the company [prevented users from sharing links to Brighteon.com](/events/facebook-blocks-links-to-brighteon/) and NaturalNews.
These moves to prevent or restrict link-sharing are likely due to the fact that these sites host content that Facebook works overtime to bury.

From [Reclaim The Net](https://archive.vn/T0REy#selection-355.0-417.121):
> ... for links that were posted to altCensored after May 28, Facebook has started blocking the preview image when they're shared on Facebook.
> Pasting these links into Facebook's sharing debugger tool confirms that the image previews are being blocked by Facebook.
