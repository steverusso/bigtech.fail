A few weeks after Twitter [suspended actor James Woods for the 2nd time](/e/twitter-locks-james-woods-account-for-paraphrasing-emerson/), he decided it was time to quit Twitter.

Quoting from the statement he [gave The Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/james-woods-releases-new-statement-about-twitter-ryan-saavedra):
> Twitter demanded that I rescind my tweet paraphrasing Emerson.
> It now seems they have chosen to delete that tweet from my account without my permission.
> Until free speech is allowed on Twitter, I will not be permitted to participate in our democracy with my voice.
> As long as Jack Dorsey remains the coward he seems to be, my Twitter days are in the past.
