Shortly after deleting some of President Trump's tweets, Twitter
[suspended](notice.jpg) Donald Trump Jr. for "spreading misinformation" after
he tweeted a link to the [highly-censored](/e/white-coat-summit/) "White
Coat Summit", a press conference held by _America's Frontline Doctors_. He
highlighted the double standard that exists around social media censorship in
an [interview with Fox News](https://youtu.be/7mpO2KAVtwo?t=73) following his
suspension:
> Conservatives, and people who believe in conservative values, have been
> targeted by these people who have no problem allowing a platform of free
> speech to the Ayatollah, to communist China, to people who are committing
> genocide, that's not a problem. But I post a video that's just an alternate
> thought by actual doctors ... and that was "spreading misinformation."
>
> . . .
>
> The Chinese government spreading disinformation is not a violation of their
> rules, but me saying "Hey, this is interesting. It's very different than the
> narrative that they've been cramming down our throats. Maybe you should watch
> it and make up your own minds.", that was enough to get thrown off the
> platform.
