Tim Pool was hit with a temporary suspension from Facebook after simply posting a link to a POLITICO opinion article titled [The New York Times Was Right to Unmask the Whistleblower](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/09/26/new-york-times-whistleblower-trump-ukraine-228529) with the caption "The New York Times was right to out Eric Ciaramella according to Politico."

Regarding the suspension, Tim says in his BitChute video description:
> As it was the first time I have ever been suspended for posting something on Facebook it was only a temporary ban. As of the filming of this video I had 6 hours left before I could post again.

> Facebook told me that reporting on this person was a "crime activity" that could cause harm even though Fox news has already named the individual twice and many other high profile personalities and news outlets have done so as well.
