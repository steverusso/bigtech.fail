Dave Cullen from Computing Forever had his interview with Prof. Dolores Cahill taken off YouTube after it was live for about a week (getting over 475k views).

YouTube cited the following guideline violation that caused the video to be removed:
> YouTube doesn't allow content that encourages or promotes violent or dangerous acts that have an inherent risk of serious harm or death.
> We also don't allow content that appears to be posted in a shocking, sensational, or disrespectful manner.

Of course, as usual, the interview is available on AltTech since it didn't contain anything that YouTube alleged nor anything remotely illegal.
