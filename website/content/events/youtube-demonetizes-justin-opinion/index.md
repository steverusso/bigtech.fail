YouTube demonetized _Justin Opinion_, a gun review channel, for "harmful
content" without being more specific:

> It's been a fun ride, guys. But now the randomly wielded axe of the socialist
> warriors who disguise themselves as corporations has fallen upon my neck.
> Creating content is far too expensive to do for free, and I'm not a popular
> enough channel for sponsorship. The future is uncertain, but at this moment
> it looks like we're done here.

According to the screenshot of the demonetization notice, "harmful content" in
this case is described as follows:

> Content showing creation, modification or sale of weapons that may result in
> injury to others. This includes links to off-site sale.
