Twitter took it upon itself to start editorializing the President's tweets
about mail-in voting ballots. The platform [inserted a
label](https://archive.vn/NtbND) saying "Get the facts about mail-in ballots"
below the following tweet(s):

> There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than
> substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &
> even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed. The Governor of California
> is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.....
>
> ...living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get
> one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people,
> many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to
> vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way!
