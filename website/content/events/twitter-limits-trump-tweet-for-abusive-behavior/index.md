Twitter disabled the likes, replies, and retweets as well as placed an abusive
behavior notice on the following tweet from President Trump:
> There will never be an “Autonomous Zone” in Washington, D.C., as long as I’m
> your President. If they try they will be met with serious force!
>
> -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [23 Jun 2020](http://archive.is/umTws)

Users are only allowed to retweet it with a comment. Twitter Safety elaborated
on the decision in a statement:
> We've placed a public interest notice on this Tweet for violating our policy
> against abusive behavior, specifically, the presence of a threat of harm
> against an identifiable group.

As Twitter [previously stated](/events/twitter-announces-rules-for-world-leaders/)
in their rules for world leaders, regarding [public interest](http://archive.is/FNXCZ#selection-733.0-739.2):
> However, if a Tweet from a world leader does violate the Twitter Rules but
> there is a clear public interest value to keeping the Tweet on the service,
> we may place it behind a notice that provides context about the violation and
> allows people to click through should they wish to see the content. [We
> announced this in June](https://archive.is/oucS0).
