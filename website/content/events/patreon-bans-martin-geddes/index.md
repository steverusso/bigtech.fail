Patreon banned Martin Geddes in an effort to purge QAnon-related material
shortly after Media Matters [published](https://archive.is/KYUQE) an article
titled "Patreon is profiting from QAnon." He had **[not
posted](https://archive.is/TCV0y) any QAnon content on Patreon**; they banned
him for his content on other platforms.
> And I have now been deplatformed by @Patreon too. This is full-on war folks â€”
> freedom of expression is dead on all of these platforms. An attack on my
> ability to fund myself and my family, too. How far will they go in this
> criminal enterprise to suppress truth about corruption?

He quickly jumped to [AltTech](/alttech/) and informed his followers about his
[SubscribeStar](/alttech/subscribestar/) account.
> If you wish to support me on a recurring basis, then my initial replacement
> for @Patreon is @SubscribeStar
> [subscribestar.com/martingeddes](https://subscribestar.com/martingeddes). I
> am likely to spread my risk across multiple platforms in future. (I have
> expenses of around $5k/year doing this job, paid out of taxable income.)
