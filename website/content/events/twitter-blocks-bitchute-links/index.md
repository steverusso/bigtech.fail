Twitter completely blocked all links to [BitChute.com](https://bitchute.com/),
an [alternative video-hosting platform](/alt/video-hosting/), meaning that
users were unable to tweet any link to that site. Twitter [restricted BitChute
links](/e/twitter-restricts-bitchute-links/) in August of 2020, and about three
months after that, [Reddit outright blocked all BitChute
links](/e/reddit-blocks-bitchute-links/) (similar to what Twitter did here).
