Twitter temporarily suspended Dr. Stella Immanuel [for six days](notice.jpg)
claiming she "violated the Twitter Rules" without giving further explanation or
even citing a specific tweet. She was one of the doctors who spoke at the
[highly-censored](/events/white-coat-summit/) "White Coat Summit", a press
conference held by _America's Frontline Doctors_.
