As the US 2020 Presidential Election started heating up, Twitter started
enforcing it's policies of editorializing and suppressing tweets they
considered potentially "misleading." Many tweets were restricted (meaning no
one could like or retweet them) and slapped with the following label:

> Some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be
> misleading about an election or other civic process.

Below are just _some_ of the tweets that Twitter editorialized, restricted,
suppressed, or outright deleted (all with accompanying archive links, as
always).

<details>
<summary>Some editorialized, restricted, and /or suppressed tweets</summary>

> Last night I was leading, often solidly, in many key States, in almost all
> instances Democrat run & controlled. Then, one by one, they started to
> magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted. VERY STRANGE, and
> the “pollsters” got it completely & historically wrong!
>
> -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/5z9mW)

> They are working hard to make up 500,000 vote advantage in Pennsylvania
> disappear — ASAP. Likewise, Michigan and others!
>
> -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/N9Dfv)

> We have claimed, for Electoral Vote purposes, the Commonwealth of
> Pennsylvania (which won’t allow legal observers) the State of Georgia, and
> the State of North Carolina, each one of which has a BIG Trump lead.
> Additionally, we hereby claim the State of Michigan if, in fact,.....
>
> .....there was a large number of secretly dumped ballots as has been widely
> reported!
>
> -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/ycY0K)

> ANY VOTE THAT CAME IN AFTER ELECTION DAY WILL NOT BE COUNTED!
>
> -- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [5 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/vw2Dt)

> This is reason enough to go to court. No honest person can look at this and
> say it's normal and unconcerning. 
>
> -- Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/fgPxx)

> Here's the message from Trump that Twitter is censoring.
>
> Trump: "We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will
> never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!"
>
> -- Sean Davis (@seanmdav) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/IurYa)

> Pennsylvania's top court said that all ballots received after election day --
> even those without a postmark -- must be assumed to have been cast by
> election day.
>
> -- Sean Davis (@seanmdav) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/BbOTj)

> The steal is on.
>
> -- Sean Davis (@seanmdav) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/Jf9nB)

> So while everyone was asleep and after everyone went home, Democrats in
> Michigan magically found a trove of 138,339 votes, and all 138,339 of those
> "votes" magically went to Biden? That doesn't look suspicious at all.
>
> -- Sean Davis (@seanmdav) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/FytFU)

> If Republicans in AZ don't get into court very quickly to institute oversight
> on the corrupt Dem in charge of Maricopa County, he's going to steal the
> election there for Biden. In light of Fox's call, pretty obvious he's pausing
> vote counts and hoping WI/MI get called for Biden.
>
> -- Sean Davis (@seanmdav) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/vTyYp)

> Yes, Democrats Are Trying To Steal The Election In Michigan, Wisconsin, And
> Pennsylvania
>
> -- The Federalist (@FDRLST) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/7wkeO)

> AZ update: apparently the use of sharpie pens in gop precincts is causing
> ballots to be invalidated. Could be huge numbers of mostly Trump supporters.
> More to come
>
> -- Matt Schlapp (@mschlapp) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/Ld2eV)

> So Trump voters using a sharpie pen will invalidate a vote, but ballots with
> an incorrect signature, or voters with no ID must be counted Bc “voter
> suppression.”
>
> -- David Reaboi (@davereaboi) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/Ch0Qc)

> Have confirmation of the sharpie issue in Arizona being a real issue. I fully
> anticipate that will be a big fight.
>
> -- Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/8n09f)

> They only stopped counting because they know @realDonaldTrump won.
>
> -- Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/9HDLc)

> The President Tweeted this a few minutes ago, but Twitter censored it.
>
> -- Mark Dice (@MarkDice) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/S77su)

> Looks like Pennsylvania is hoping to count ballots for the rest of the week
> that weren't postmarked on time, hoping to steal this for Biden since Trump
> is up by 700,000.
>
> -- Mark Dice (@MarkDice) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/jN6Sx)

> Trump was trending to win WI, MI, and PA, which will secure his victory, so
> they stopped counting the votes.  #StopTheSteal
>
> -- Mark Dice (@MarkDice) [4 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/cvtNG)

> They are waiting to see how many mail-in ballots they will need
>
> No other good explanation
>
> This should be treated as evidence of intent to commit election fraud
>
> -- Will Chamberlain (@willchamberlain) [5 Nov 2020](https://archive.is/rFuWJ)

> I see dead people voting
> 👀
>
>
> Look no further than PA's own records
> 🧟‍♂️
