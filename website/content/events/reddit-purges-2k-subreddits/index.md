Reddit purged about 2,000 subreddits for "offensive content",
[claiming](http://archive.is/7yRAm#selection-1907.0-1911.31) that only 200 of
them had more than 10 daily active users. These bans came shortly after Reddit
updated its policies to include [this gem](http://archive.is/OZ03o#selection-185.0-185.219):
> While the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect all groups
> or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does not protect groups of
> people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate.

The platform [published](http://archive.is/wfch8#selection-9.145-9.454) the top
10 subreddits that were banned, ranked by daily average users (DAU):

| Subreddit | 7 Day DAU |
| --- | --- |
| darkhumorandmemes | 49,893 |
| chapotraphouse | 42,949 |
| consumeproduct | 30,349 |
| darkjokecentral | 27,356 |
| gendercritical | 27,333 |
| cumtown | 8,091 |
| wojak | 7,813 |
| the_donald | 7,780 |
| imgoingtohellforthis2 | 7,073 |
| thenewright | 6,844 |

r/The_Donald was [quarantined by
Reddit](/events/reddit-quarantines-the-donald-subreddit/) a year prior, and the
subreddit's mods placed it into "restricted mode" four months before this
removal.

Another popular subreddit that got caught up in this purge was
[r/hatecrimehoaxes](http://archive.is/KMl3d).
> Just found out that the other Reddit hate crime hoax sub just got the ban

> White Supremacist subs, but I believe all races are equally valuable so I
> didn't say anything...And then...
