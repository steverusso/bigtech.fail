[YouTube](/youtube/) permanently [banned](/tags/banned/) _The Last American

nearly **103k subscribers** and over **14.5 million total views** across more
than 2,000 videos.

> @YouTube Just proved me right, by deleting TLAV. This happened because I am

_The Last American Vagabond_ pushed back when YouTube attempted their usual,
two-faced customer service a couple days later on [Twitter](/twitter/), saying
they were "Sorry to hear about the trouble" and that he could contact them if
he thought his channel "was terminated by mistake."

> Are you serious? Don’t meekly come into the comments acting like you want to
> resolve anything. Not even an email was sent before you removed a decade a
> work. That’s not how an honest party operates. How about this: If YOU think
> this was done in error, you email ME #BoycottYouTube
