Twitter temporarily suspended Titania McGrath, a satirical SJW account
run by comedian Andrew Doyle.

"Titania" was unsuspended about five days later:
> Twitter’s Trust and Safety Council must have mistaken me for a fake account,
> but has now repented.
>
> As a token of my gratitude, I have added a chapter about @jack to my
> forthcoming book. 
>
> I’m sure he’ll be thrilled.
