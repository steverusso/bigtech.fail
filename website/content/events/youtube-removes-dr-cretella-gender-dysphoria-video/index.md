YouTube removed Dr. Cretella's video due to "hate speech" violations based on the following content:

> See, according to most mainstream medical organizations, if you want to cut off a healthy arm or a healthy leg, you’re mentally ill. But if you want to cut off healthy breasts or a penis, you’re transgender.

According to The Daily Signal, YouTube told them the video could be allowed back on the platform if the above content was removed.
