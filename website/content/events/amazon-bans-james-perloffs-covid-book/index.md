Amazon removed a book titled _"COVID-19 and the Agendas to Come, Red-Pilled"_
by James Perloff due to "content guidelines" violations. The book had sold
3,500 copies, and the Kindle version was about to be released. From Perloff's
[blog post](https://archive.is/4sQrp#selection-305.32-305.235):
> ...Amazon sent me a second unsigned email. This one indicated that Amazon was
> completely removing the book from sale—suddenly, it was no longer about
> rights; now it was about violating “content guidelines.”
>
> I asked Amazon to specify what content guidelines I had violated. Their
> answer wasn’t enlightening:
>
> **We’ve reviewed your book “COVID-19 and the Agendas to Come, Red-Pilled”, and
> found that it is in violation of our content guidelines and we will not be
> offering this title for sale on Amazon.  We reserve the right to determine
> whether content provides a poor customer experience and remove that content
> from sale.**
