After facing pressure from activists, Twitter temporarily suspended the account
of Katie Hopkins, a British political commentator who was occasionally
retweeted by Pres. Trump. Her account had over 1 million followers at the time
she was suspended.

One day prior to this suspension, an activist tweeted about a meeting they had
with Twitter where they called for the platform to "review" Katie Hopkins'
account. In that tweet, they reference [this tweet
(archived)](https://archive.vn/CF9FV) which contains [this
screenshot](stormzy-tweets-screenshot.jpg) of some of Hopkins' tweets from
about a month prior, which suggests that may have been what prompted the
suspension.

Twitter gave the [following statement](https://archive.vn/bFO5w#selection-803.0-803.422):
> Keeping Twitter safe is a top priority for — abuse and harassment have no
> place on the service. We take enforcement action against any account that is
> violative of our rules — which includes violations of our hateful conduct
> policy and abusive behavior policy. These rules apply to everyone using our
> service, regardless of the account involved.
