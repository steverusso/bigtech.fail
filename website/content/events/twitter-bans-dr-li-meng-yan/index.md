[Dr. Li-Meng Yan](https://archive.is/2inFX) is a Chinese virologist from the
University of Hong Kong who emerged as a whistleblower after claiming COVID-19
was lab-driven and accusing the Chinese Communist Party of [covering it
up](https://archive.is/uF15T). In April 2020, she [fled Hong
Kong](https://archive.is/ItGnP) for safety in the US, later [telling
Fox](https://archive.is/leHOp#selection-2035.1-2035.85):
> The reason I came to the U.S. is because I deliver the message of the truth
> of COVID

Dr. Yan joined Twitter on September 13, 2020. She was **banned about two days
later** after [tweeting a link](https://archive.is/xHuaA) to the pre-print of a
paper that claimed COVID-19 was created in a lab. Her account had four tweets
and accumulated about 60k followers in the time before it was removed. As
[ZeroHedge](https://archive.is/dyNHD#selection-843.0-880.1) reported:
> On Sunday afternoon we asked how long before the twitter account of the
> "rogue" Chinese virologist, Dr. Li-Meng Yan ... is "silenced."
>
> We now have the answer: less than two days.
