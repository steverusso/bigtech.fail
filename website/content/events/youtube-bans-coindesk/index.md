YouTube banned [_CoinDesk_](https://www.coindesk.com/), an independent news
outlet that mostly focuses on crypto-currency news and updates. As to the
reason, [CoinDesk reported](https://archive.is/7VjX5#selection-6589.0-6589.184)
that YouTube emailed the following with no elaboration: "Content that
encourages illegal activities or incites users to violate YouTube's guidelines
is not allowed on YouTube."

> The entire @CoinDesk channel, including “The Hash” which I co-host, was
> deleted from YouTube. Please watch the show on
> [coindesk.tv](http://coindesk.tv) 🙏 🙏 (Much better than trusting a 3rd
> party to host your content!)
>
> This is why @LBRYcom exists, and I’m so grateful for it 🙏

The channel was reinstated about two days later when YouTube confirmed that
CoinDesk's channel is in fact not in violation of their guidelines.
