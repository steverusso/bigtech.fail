Google removed the Android app for Gab.ai from the Play Store claiming that Gab wasn't removing controversial content from its platform.
Gab is branded as the free speech, non-authoritarian alternative to Twitter, so of course they're not going to start censoring content for arbitrary reasons.

Google gave Breitbart the following statement:
> In order to be on the Play Store, social networking apps need to demonstrate a sufficient level of moderation, including for content that encourages violence and advocates hate against groups of people.
> This is a long-standing rule and clearly stated in our developer policies.
> Developers always have the opportunity to appeal a suspension and may have their apps reinstated if they've addressed the policy violations and are compliant with our Developer Program Policies.

An event like this begs the question: what role does a company like _Google_ play in the censorship decisions of a platform like _Twitter_?

Gab [filed a lawsuit](https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/gabai-sues-google/) against Google [about a month later](https://pjmedia.com/trending/2017/09/18/gab-ai-sues-google-removal-app-google-play-store/).
