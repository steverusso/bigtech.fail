[YouTube](/youtube/) demonetized _One America News_, a right wing media outlet,
and gave them a one week suspension shortly after activists from several
corporate media organizations published articles
([CNN](https://archive.is/7yBhT), [CNBC](https://archive.is/SC9Vb),
[NYT](https://archive.is/Y69m5)) complaining that the channel was spreading
"misinformation" regarding the election and COVID.

A YouTube spokesperson [told Axios](https://archive.is/zGYH9) that the channel
was suspended and demonetized for "promoting a phony cure for COVID" in a video
which _One America News_ claimed was not even publicly listed on YouTube.

> .@OANN on YouTube suspension (1/3):
>
> "YouTube took the extreme action of censoring a national cable news network
> for a video that was ‘unlisted’ and not available publicly on YouTube."

About three weeks later, Facebook [removed the
ability](/e/facebook-disables-livestreaming-for-oann/) for _One America
News_ to livestream to the network's paid supporters.
