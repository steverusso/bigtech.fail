[Twitter](/twitter/) permanmently banned President Trump shortly after [his 12
hour suspension](/events/twitter-facebook-suspend-trump/) was lifted. Right
after his personal account was banned, he issued the following statement from
the @POTUS account, causing that account to be removed as well.

> As I have been saying for a long time, Twitter has gone further and further
> in banning free speech, and tonight, Twitter employees have coordinated with
> the Democrats and the Radical Left in removing my account from their
> platform, to silence me – and YOU, the 75,000,000 great Patriots who voted
> for me.
>
> Twitter may be a private company but without the government’s gift of Section
> 230 they would not exist for long. I predicted this would happen.
>
> We have been negotiating with various other sites, and will have a big
> announcement soon, while we also look at the possibilities of building out
> our own platform in the near future.
>
> We will not be SILENCED! Twitter is not about FREE SPEECH. They are all about
> promoting a Radical Left platform where some of the most vicious people in
> the world are allowed to speak freely.
>
> STAY TUNED!

In a blog post, [Twitter
highlighted](https://archive.is/e8WIO#selection-665.0-689.194) the ~~absurd~~
reasoning behind why they banned the President:

> On January 8, 2021, President Donald J. Trump tweeted:
>
> “The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and
> MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They
> will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!”
>
> Shortly thereafter, the President tweeted:
>
> “To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on
> January 20th.”
>
> [...] After assessing the language in these Tweets against our Glorification of
> Violence policy, we have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the
> Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be
> immediately permanently suspended from the service. 

Trump then used his campaign account (@TeamTrump) to tweet, and it was banned
seconds later.

> Can confirm @TeamTrump has been suspended for doing absolutely nothing wrong.
>
> All we did was post what @HansNichols sent out in a White House pool report.
> It was a statement from the President of the United States.
