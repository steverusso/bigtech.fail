Twitter removed the European Parliment campaign accounts for Carl Benjamin
(aka. Sargon of Akkad) and Tommy Robinson less than a month before the
election. They were running as members of the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

Twitter did not comment or give explanation as to why Robinson was banned, but
the platform did [inform Benjamin](carl-benjamin-mep-ban-notice.jpg) that the
account was removed for violating their "rules against evading permanent
suspension," presumably since Twitter had permanently banned both [Carl
Benjamin](/events/twitter-bans-sargon/) and [Tommy
Robinson](/events/twitter-bans-tommy-robinson/).

However, the accounts were being operated solely by campaign staff members. A
member of Benjamin's staff tweeted the following:
> Hi @Twitter @TwitterUK this ban reason for @CarlUKIP is demonstrably false,
> we on the team took pains and made a concerted effort to ensure that Carl
> never operated the account for this express reason. It was a purely campaign
> account to announce campaign days and press releases
