Patreon "suspended" _The Corbett Report_ until certain posts were deleted.
James Corbett [mentioned in a video
update](https://odysee.com/@corbettreport:0/hellogoing:1?t=349) that he's not
going to delete anything for Patreon, so this essentially is a ban:

> [...], you should know that Patreon has, to the suprise of absolutely no one,
> least of all myself, "suspended my account" until such time as I voluntarily
> self-delete a few videos that they have told me I must delete because they
> contain wrongthink in this age of the new abnormal. Well, surprise surprise,
> no I am not going to delete any of my videos, not for Patreon or anyone else.

The account had about 1,700 patrons before the "suspension."
