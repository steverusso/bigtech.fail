Twitter permanently banned Sargon of Akkad for, as they say, "violating the Twitter Rules", specifically for "participating in targeted abuse", except... they didn't even name a "target" or the "abuse."
This came about 7 months after they [temporarily suspended his account](/events/twitter-suspends-sargon/) in January of the same year.
