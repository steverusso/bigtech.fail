Twitter permanently banned Sargon of Akkad for, as they say, "violating the
Twitter Rules", specifically for "participating in targeted abuse", except...
they didn't even name a "target" or the "abuse."

This happened about seven months after Twitter [temporarily suspended Sargon's
account](/e/twitter-suspends-sargon/).
