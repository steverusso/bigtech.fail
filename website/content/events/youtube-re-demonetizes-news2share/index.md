Six months after [demonetizing](/e/youtube-demonetizes-news2share/)
_News2Share_ as part of the [Vox Adpocalypse](/vox-adpocalypse/), YouTube
allowed the channel to be monetized again, but demonetized each and every video
on the channel:
> While @TeamYouTube apparently remonetized my 1200 video \*channel\*
> yesterday, every \*video\* was demonetized.
>
> Some falsely were marked as confirmed manually as unsuitable; some marked as
> under review. About 1/4 of them had the option to request review.
>
> I did.
>
> All reviews denied.
