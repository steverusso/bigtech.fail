[1171](https://www.krisannehall.com/index.php/resources/the-krisanne-hall-show/663-episode-1171-special-edition-suspended-on-twitter)
of The KrisAnne Hall Show, she speculates that she might have been removed from
Twitter for continually posting information about COVID-19, particularly the
recent CDC report showing that [94% of COVID-19 deaths had other contributing
conditions](https://archive.is/5OKqt#selection-3955.0-3955.13):
> Everybody's quoting CDC on why you have to wear a mask and why you have to
> social distance. Well now CDC is telling you something, and now you go to
> Twitter jail for directly quoting the CDC.
