Journalist Max Blumenthal published [an article](https://archive.is/DJiiu) for
_The Grayzone_ [which covered](https://archive.is/DJiiu#selection-915.0-919.1)
recently leaked docuemnts exposing how the UK government funded a propaganda
campaign involving several corporate media outlets that was aimed at weakening
Russian state influence:

> The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) have sponsored Reuters and the
> BBC to conduct a series of covert programs aimed at promoting regime change
> inside Russia and undermining its government across Eastern Europe and
> Central Asia, according to a series of leaked documents.

Twitter placed a warning label on any tweet that contained a link to the
article that read: "These materials may have been obtained through hacking."

> Twitter's introduction of warning labels to specifically apply to my factual
> reporting on covert UK info ops builds off of the policy it introduced in
> October to block links to a NY Post story on Hunter Biden's corruption, which
> was also based in fact
