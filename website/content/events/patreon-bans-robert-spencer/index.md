Patreon banned Robert Spencer, best selling author and Director of [Jihad Watch](https://jihadwatch.org/), after caving to pressure from _Mastercard_.
From his ban notice:
> Mastercard has a stricter set of rules and regulations than Patreon, and they reserve the right to not offer their services to accounts of their choosing.
> This is in line with their terms of service, which means itâ€™s something we have to comply by.

This ban from Patreon turned out to be only a part of the [larger financial deplatforming](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/gofundme-blocks-islam-scholar-robert-spencer-after-ban-by-mastercard-patreo) targeting Spencer.
