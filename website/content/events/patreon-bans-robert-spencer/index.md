Patreon banned Robert Spencer, best selling author and Director of [Jihad
Watch](https://jihadwatch.org/), after caving to pressure from Mastercard, who
was just [caving to pressure from the SPLC](https://archive.is/cLniJ). From his
ban notice:

> Mastercard has a stricter set of rules and regulations than Patreon, and they
> reserve the right to not offer their services to accounts of their choosing.
> This is in line with their terms of service, which means it’s something we
> have to comply by.

This ban from Patreon turned out to be only a part of the [larger financial
deplatforming](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/gofundme-blocks-islam-scholar-robert-spencer-after-ban-by-mastercard-patreo)
targeting Spencer.
