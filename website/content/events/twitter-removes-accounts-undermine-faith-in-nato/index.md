Twitter announced the [permanent removal of 373 "state-affiliated"
accounts](https://archive.is/NdkNb#selection-589.87-593.10) that they
attributed to Armenia, Russia and Iran:

> The networks we are disclosing relate to independent, state-affiliated
> information operations that we have attributed to Armenia, Russia and a
> previously disclosed network from Iran.
>
> Once our investigations were complete, the 373 associated accounts across the
> four networks were permanently suspended from Twitter for violations of our
> platform manipulation policies.

The Iranian accounts that were removed were the final part of Twitter's
enforcement action that started back in October of 2020 when they initially
[removed 130 accounts attributed to
Iran](/e/twitter-removes-iranian-accounts-tip-from-fbi/) that they claimed were
attempting to "disrupt the public conversation during the first 2020 US
Presidential Debate" based on a tip from the FBI. However, Twitter's reasoning
behind this recent removal of Armenian and Russian accounts was due to those
accounts being opposed to certain NATO interests:

> [...] we investigated and removed 35 accounts that had ties to the Government of
> Armenia. These accounts were created in order to advance narratives that were
> targeting Azerbaijan and were geostrategically favorable to the Armenian
> government. In some cases, the fake accounts purported to represent
> government and political figures in Azerbaijan, as well as news entities
> claiming to operate in Azerbaijan.

> [...] removed a network of 69 fake accounts that can be reliably tied to
> Russian state actors. A number of these accounts amplified narratives that
> were aligned with the Russian government, while another subset of the network
> focused on undermining faith in the NATO alliance and its stability.

In the case of the Armenian accounts, Twitter forgot to include the full
context regarding the [Nagorno-Karabakh
war](https://archive.is/isBZK#selection-761.0-767.345) that just took place
between Azerbaijan and Armenia where NATO-backed Turkey helped Azerbaijan take
control the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Journalist Max Blumenthal did [a segment
on Jimmy Dore's show](https://youtu.be/yI4AuWlO9iA?t=158) where he summarized
the situation very well:

> This is further confirmation of Twitter acting as a US regime propaganda
> site, [...]. Armenians were massacred with help from NATO. Basically, here
> was just a war in the Nagorno-Karabakh region started by Azerbaijan. It's
> like what you would call contested territory. Most of the population there is
> Armenian.  They consider it Armenia, and Azerbaijan violated a cease-fire, as
> far as I know, to attack it, to try to take it as part of Azerbaijan, they
> were the stronger military party, and who were they supported by? Erdoğan's
> Turkey, which is a member of NATO. He brought in drones, military
> intelligence support, and thousands of Turkish mercenaries known as the TFSA,
> the Turkish Free Syrian Army. [...] he sent them over to fight in
> Nagorno-Karabakh, known as Artsakh by Armenians, and they won that little war
> that they started with NATO backing. And Armenia, which has suffered a
> genocide by the hands of Turkey, is now being targeted on Twitter along with
> these other states that NATO is targeting. [...] This is information warfare.
> Twitter is intervening on behalf of NATO because it's being run by pro-NATO
> or directly NATO forces.  [...] they don't want our faith in NATO to be
> undermined. They don't want us to think about what NATO even is or why it
> even exists after the Cold War. It exists to start another Cold War, to
> justify its own existence and its budget [...].
