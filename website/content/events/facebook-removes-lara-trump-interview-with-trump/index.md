Facebook removed a video of Lara Trump interviewing her father-in-law, former
President Trump, because Facebook **disallowed any content "in the voice of
President Trump" on its platforms** after ["suspending"
him](/e/twitter-facebook-suspend-trump/) a few months prior, [according to Fox
News](https://archive.ph/WI6eu#selection-1559.0-1559.369):

> A group of Trump officials were sent an email from a Facebook employee,
> warning that any content posted on Facebook and Instagram "in the voice of
> President Trump is not currently allowed on our platforms (including new
> posts with President Trump speaking)" and warned that it "will be removed if
> posted, resulting in additional limitations on accounts that posted it."

The interview is still viewable [on
Rumble](https://rumble.com/vf7jdd-the-right-view-with-president-donald-j-trump-and-lara-trump.html).
