While appearing on CNN, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said "anything that would go
against World Health Organization recommendations would be a violation of our
policy."

This is in addition to removing any content that is "medically unsubstantiated"
or considered "problematic information." In other words, any content published
on YouTube that contradicts the WHO would be taken down.

And yes, this is the same WHO that [echos Chinese
propaganda](https://archive.vn/JlxWy) with a director who goes on
[random tirades against
Taiwan](https://thefederalist.com/2020/04/15/world-health-organization-director-again-parrots-chinese-propaganda-in-anti-taiwan-tirade/).
