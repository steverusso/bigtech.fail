> According to news reports, Amazon has been taking down long-running
> documentaries from its site with little or no warning, and apparently it is
> almost impossible to receive a response as to why a documentary was taken
> down. [...] it is very strange that Amazon could not find space on its
> website to stream a documentary on our longest-serving black Supreme Court
> justice in American history that ran on PBS in a national broadcast (no small
> feat) and is a top-selling DVD in its documentary section, while less popular
> documentaries on Justice Marshall are still streaming.
