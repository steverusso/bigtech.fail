Mailchimp banned [_TorrentFreak_](https://torrentfreak.com/about/), a news
publication focused on topics around copyright, privacy and file sharing.
Mailchimp told TorrentFreak that their automated abuse-prevention system
"detected account content that violates our Acceptable Use Policy" and that
"the risk associated with your account is too great for us to continue to
support."

> A few days ago, our newsletter provider MailChimp kicked us out because our
> content is too risky for its business. Apparently, overactive spam filters
> don't really like the topics we cover. 

Ernesto Van der Sar, founder of _TorrentFreak_, aptly points out that the
larger problem here isn't solely with Mailchimp, but instead also has something
to do with the current underlying infrastrucutre of the internet:

> What’s really to blame here are the automated filters from ISPs and anti-spam
> outfits that wrongly tag certain content as problematic. Too many
> piracy-related keywords, which is what you would find on a piracy-related
> news site like ours, can apparently get entire servers blocked.
