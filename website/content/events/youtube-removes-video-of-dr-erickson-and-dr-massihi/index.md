YouTube removed an hour long video of Dr. Dan Erickson and Dr. Artin Massihi,
co-owners of Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield, CA, arguing against the
government measures meant to fight COVID-19. The video received more than 5
million views before being removed, happening about a week after YouTube's CEO
said the platform would be [removing any content that contradicts the World Health
Organization](/e/youtube-says-contradicting-who-will-violate-guidelines/).

In the video, Dr. Erickson mentions anecdotally how doctors are being pressured
to add COVID to death certificates:
> But ER doctors now, my friends that I talk to, say "You know, it's
> interesting. When I'm writing up my death report, I'm being pressured to add
> COVID. Why is that?"

He later summarizes his and Dr. Massihi's position on the whole situation:
> ... when I look at the basic tenants that we know of microbiology, I say do
> we need to still shelter in place? Our answer is, emphatically, no. Do we
> need businesses to be shutdown? Emphatically, no. Do we need to test them and
> get them back to work? Yes, we do. The secondary effects that we went over,
> the child abuse, alcoholism, loss of revenue, all of these are, in our
> opinion, a significantly more detrimental thing to society than a virus that
> has proven similar in nature to the seasonal flu we have every year.
