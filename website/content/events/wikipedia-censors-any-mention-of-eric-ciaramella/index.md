Wikipedia admins used their editorial power to censor any mention of the name
"Eric Ciaramella" after it became widely publicized (initially [by
_RealClearInvestigations_](https://archive.is/CHS9W)) that he was the alleged
[Trump-Ukraine "whistleblower."](https://archive.is/hSJQi) The methods of
suppression included:

* blocking edits that attempted to add "Eric Ciaramella" to Wikipedia's Whistleblower page and [classifying them as "vandalism"](https://archive.is/VhNLc#selection-197.1-197.21)
* blocking edits that attempted to add "Eric Ciaramella" to Wikipedia's Trump-Ukraine controversy page and [classifying them as: "grossly insulting, degrading, or offensive material" and "serious \[Biographies of Living Persons\] vioations"](https://archive.is/hM8su#selection-407.1-557.12)
* blocking draft pages about Eric Ciarmella and [classifying them as "attack pages"](https://archive.is/uBOk9#selection-545.10-545.46)
* [implementing a filter](https://archive.is/WwOLr#selection-8155.0-8517.52) to further prevent future mentions of the alleged "whistleblower's" name
* [banning editors](https://archive.is/S6eVq#selection-541.0-553.1) who challenged the above actions taken by admins
* [threatening to ban editors](https://archive.is/vEsFR#selection-345.49-345.471) who violated the above preventative measures

A former Wikipedia editor, who writes under the alias [T.D.
Adler](https://www.breitbart.com/author/t-d-adler/), wrote a very thorough
[piece for
Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/11/10/wikipedia-admins-censor-name-of-alleged-ukraine-whistleblower/)
covering this censorship in which he highlighted how the Wikipedia admins even
claimed there was a lack of "reliable" sources covering the story, despite that
not being true:

> Left-wing editors argued against including Ciaramella’s name over a lack of
> “reliable sources” mentioning it. Sources such as RealClearInvestigations and
> others were cited, but editors often dismiss conservative sources as
> “unreliable” on Wikipedia. [...] However, sources considered reliable on
> Wikipedia, the Dallas Morning News and Ukrainian state-owned UNIAN, also
> reported the alleged whistleblower’s name.
