[Twitter](/twitter/) permanently banned Carey Wedler (@CareyWedler) for no
reason on the same day that _The Anti-Media_ (the outlet where she served as
editor-in-chief) was [banned by both Facebook and
Twitter](/events/facebook-twitter-ban-antimedia/). Her nine year old account
had over **4k followers**. In a video she released the same day, Wedler [said
the following](https://youtu.be/q4zu_QS6hK4?t=49):

> I just found out I was suspended from Twitter, my personal account suspended.
> I got an email saying I violated the Terms of Service. No specifics. I have
> no idea what they could possibly be talking about. I've never been suspended
> from anything, ever.
