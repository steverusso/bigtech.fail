Project Veritas released an exposé regarding Google's political and election
influence. Google did not comment or respond to this publication in any way,
and it received almost no corporate media coverage. The full exposé was broken
into three videos of hidden camera footage which were released over the course
of three days. Below are some highlights. The full videos are available on the
Project Veritas website (linked below).

[Part 1](https://www.projectveritas.com/video/senior-google-manager-on-search-engines-power-you-are-just-plain-and-simple/)
featured Ritesh Lakhkar, a Technical Program Manager for Google Cloud. Veritas
highlighted his quote of how Google is "Plain and simple trying to play god"
refering to the manipulation of Google Search. However, perhaps more damning,
he talked about how Google has likely collaborated **in secret** with the **CCP
(Chinese Communist Party)**, as well as **both the Democrat and Repubilcan
parties** in the US:

> [...] the wind is blowing toward Democrats [...] even
> though GOP may have good traits, [...] so let's skew the results towards
> Democrats. I guarantee you four years from today, after the elections,
> depending on the performance, the wind may blow towards GOP.
> 
> [...]
>
> And I'm pretty sure they've already collaborated with the Democrats and
> Republicans both, just in the name of money. [...] If these companies are
> gonna go in and be in bed with Chinese Communist Party, there's nothing
> stopping them from getting in bed with both Democrats and Republicans here in
> the US.

[Part 2](https://www.projectveritas.com/video/more-google-speech-suppression-google-advertising-manager-boasts-company-can/)
featured Adriano Amaduzzi, an employee from Google's overseas Ad Sales
division. He talked about how Google disallows advertising for "right-wing
parties" and those that the company determines are spreading "hate speech."
This is on top of doing things such as offering free advertising to Democrat
Organizations. He also mentioned how he prevented the UK Conservative Party
from advertising about Brexit by simply not responding to those customer
requests:

> Funnily enough, about Brexit, I had a guy [...] contacting me, saying "Hi I'm
> the Head of Digital Infrastructure of the Conservative Party of the United
> Kingdom. We would like to do advertising with Google. Could you help me with
> that?" I was like, I didn't answer.

[Part
3](https://www.projectveritas.com/video/google-election-influence-exposed-senior-google-executive-ashwin-agrawal/)
featured Ashwin Agrawal, the Head of Global Competitive Analysis for Google
Cloud. He did talk about the aspects of Google Search and Google Ads that were
mentioned in the previous videos, but mainly focused on Google's ability in
general to influence people without their knowledge...

> I think it doesn't matter whether someone in Facebook or Google is sitting
> and thinking about this. The truth is that these platforms are influencing
> you in a way that you didn't sign up for, that's my view.
