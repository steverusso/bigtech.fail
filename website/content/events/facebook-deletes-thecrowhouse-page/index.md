Facebook deleted the page for Max Igan's _TheCrowhouse_, likely for speaking out
against COVID-19 misinformation. In a video following the deletion, Max said:

> And the purging of information of anybody who's speaking out against this on

YouTube did in fact [delete](/e/youtube-bans-thecrowhouse) Max Igan's
channel _TheCrowhouse_ just over two months later.
