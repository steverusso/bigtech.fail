YouTube banned [_Titus
Frost_](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/2Zo51w9MJ8db/), a political content
creator, in an attempt to purge channels that the platform claimed were
spreading "harmful conspiracy theories." The five year old channel had about
**44k subscribers** and just over **4 million total views** across 752 videos.

> Yep. Looks like it finally happened. They deleted my main YouTube account
> with 44,600 subscribers. The “Titus Frost” Channel has been officially
> deleted by YouTube. Almost made it to 50k subs before they terminated me. It
> was a fun ride while it lasted. 5 years of work deleted.
