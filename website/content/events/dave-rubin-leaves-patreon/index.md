Like many other creators, Dave Rubin experienced severe Patreon losses due to the [Sargon ban](/e/patreon-bans-sargon/).
On January 1, 2019, he and Jordan Peterson decided they would both delete their Patreon accounts on January 15.

Below is Rubin's tweet announcing his Patreon account deletion:

> Weâ€™ve had a great run, Patreon, but I gotta let you go. Will be deleting my account during livestream this afternoon.
>
> Beyond thanks to all of you who have moved your support over to [http://www.daverubin.com/donate](http://www.daverubin.com/donate) . This is just the first of several big steps over the next few months... [[image]](letter.jpg)

In November of 2018, Rubin had the [31st largest 'Video'](https://graphtreon.com/monthly-ranking/video#Nov2018) Patreon account.
