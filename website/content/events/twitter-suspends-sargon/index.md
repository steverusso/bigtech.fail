Twitter temporarily suspended Sargon of Akkad without giving a reason or
explanation. Initially, it was thought that he was suspended for the following
tweet at EU politicians:
> Hasn't mass Islamic migration to Europe drastically raised the odds of terror
> attacks, though? @FedericaMog @MartinSelmayr

However, a little while later, a Twitter user claimed to have reported Sargon
for tweeting a pornographic image in a reply and posted [a
screenshot](https://tweetsave.com/yung_domon/status/825065911673552896) of a
message from Twitter saying that they investigated and suspended Sargon for
"abusive behavior" after the user reported him.
