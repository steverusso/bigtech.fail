Facebook released an update on how the platform has been dealing with "violent
organizations." This of course
[included](http://archive.is/QutUY#selection-1855.0-1855.320) the _non-violent_
conspiracy group QAnon:
> As a result of some of the actions we’ve already taken, we’ve removed over
> 790 groups, 100 Pages and 1,500 ads tied to QAnon from Facebook, blocked over
> 300 hashtags across Facebook and Instagram, and additionally imposed
> restrictions on over 1,950 Groups and 440 Pages on Facebook and over 10,000
> accounts on Instagram.

And it wasn't just QAnon. Facebook
[reported](http://archive.is/QutUY#selection-1855.743-1855.1016) a relevantly
smaller (but still somewhat significant) number of enforcement measures taken
against pages, ads, and groups related to Antifa (a far _left_ organization).
> For militia organizations and those encouraging riots, including some who may
> identify as Antifa, we’ve initially removed over 980 groups, 520 Pages and
> 160 ads from Facebook. We’ve also restricted over 1,400 hashtags related to
> these groups and organizations on Instagram.

As eventually happens with censorship, it slowly grows to include everyone.
