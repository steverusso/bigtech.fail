The [r/The_Donald](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/) subreddit started to
heat up a bit (along with the rest of the internet) back in June of 2019 amid
the [Oregon controversy](http://archive.is/XGyMa) where lawmakers walked out on
a vote for a climate change bill. Due to "repeated rule breaking behavior", to
Reddit decided to [quarantine](http://archive.is/qDUjo) r/The_Donald.

From Reddit's quarantine notice:
> Over the last few months we have observed repeated rule-breaking behavior in
> your community and an over-reliance on Reddit admins to manage users and
> remove posts that violate our content policy, including content that
> encourages or incites violence. Most recently, we have observed this behavior
> in the form of encouragement of violence towards police officers and public
> officials in Oregon.

Congressman Jim Banks points out [in his RealClearPolitics
article](http://archive.is/PFlFb) that these measures against "rule breaking
behavior" are not enforced equally or fairly:
> I’m not going to belabor my point and list the thousands of unaddressed,
> rule-breaking comments on left-wing subreddits. The point is, when such
> comments are posted in apolitical or left-wing subreddits, nothing happens.

Luckily, r/The_Donald has relocated to its own site:
[TheDonald.win](https://thedonald.win)

Reddit would [completely remove](/e/reddit-purges-2k-subreddits/)
r/The_Donald on June 29, 2020, four months after the mods placed the subreddit
into "restricted mode."
