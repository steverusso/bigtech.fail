The [r/The_Donald](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/) subreddit started to heat up a bit (along with the rest of the internet) back in June of 2019 amid the [Oregon controversy](https://www.thedailybeast.com/oregon-statehouse-shut-down-after-lawmakers-flee-team-up-with-right-wing-militias) where lawmakers walked out on a vote for a climate change bill.
Due to "repeated rule breaking behavior", to Reddit decided to [quarantine](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/quarantined-subreddits) r/The_Donald.

From Reddit's quarantine notice:
> Over the last few months we have observed repeated rule-breaking behavior in your community and an over-reliance on Reddit admins to manage users and remove posts that violate our content policy, including content that encourages or incites violence.
> Most recently, we have observed this behavior in the form of encouragement of violence towards police officers and public officials in Oregon.

Congressman Jim Banks points out [in his RealClearPolitics article](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/10/31/reddit_must_end_politically_motivated_publishing_decisions_141623.html) that these measures against "rule breaking behavior" are not enforced equally or fairly:
> Iâ€™m not going to belabor my point and list the thousands of unaddressed, rule-breaking comments on left-wing subreddits.
> The point is, when such comments are posted in apolitical or left-wing subreddits, nothing happens.

Luckily, r/The_Donald has relocated to its own site: [TheDonald.win](https://thedonald.win)
