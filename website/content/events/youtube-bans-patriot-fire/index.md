YouTube removed Roger Ogden's channel _Patriot Fire_ coinciding with a spike in popularity for what ended up being his last videos on the platform.

Ogden, [speaking to The Gateway Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2019/10/google-leftists-strike-again-youtube-removes-channel-on-trump-border-wall-constrution-says-it-is-hate-speech-and-promotes-violence/), said:
> I think, though, that it may have had something to do with the coming election and that my videos about the border were becoming too popular.
> I didnâ€™t have any strikes against the channel and had almost exclusively been doing videos about the border in recent months.
> The video had received something like 300K views already and growing.
> I was not trying to be partisan, neither pro-Trump nor Anti-Trump in these videos, but just factual.

His border wall videos are still going strong [on BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/channel/patriotfire/).
