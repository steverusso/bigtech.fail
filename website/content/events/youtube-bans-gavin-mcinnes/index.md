YouTube banned Gavin McInnes. His 15 year old channel more than **350k
subscribers** and over **30 million lifetime views**. The reasons [YouTube
gave](http://archive.is/f9iUG#selection-789.67-789.240) for banning him were
"inciting violence against another person or group" and "creating content that
encourages hatred of another person or group of people." The platform did not
provide any specific examples.

Several days prior, meme maker Carpe Donktum had an interview with Gavin
McInnes [removed](http://archive.is/rCz2j) from Facebook since even featuring
Gavin is a community guidelines violation (and not just on Facebook).
