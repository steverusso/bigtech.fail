Mailchimp banned Stefan Molyneux, host of the online philosophy show
_Freedomain Radio_, after he was slandered by activists on Twitter as someone
who "promotes eugenics, race science and "men's rights" activism."

> 1. I oppose eugenics as an egregious State violation of the non-aggression
>    principle.
> 2. I have interviewed 17 leading scientists on human intelligence - including
>    leftists: [fdrurl.com/IQ](https://www.freedomain.com/2020/07/14/iq/)
> 3. I am not a “white nationalist”
> 4. What is wrong with “men’s rights”?
