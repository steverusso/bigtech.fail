In December of 2018, Patreon purged several accounts for political reasons, which not only caused massive losses for other creators, but also severely underminded many creators' confidence in the platform.

By the end of the month, Tim Pool decided to take a stand and make one final post to Patreon:
> I will no longer be posting to this Patreon but it will remain active for those who are still using it.
> If you would like to support me elsewhere go to [timcast.com/donate](https://www.timcast.com/donate).
> Feel free to support me on Patreon if you choose
