"Blue Anon" is a term [invented to describe absurd left-wing conspiracy
theorists](https://archive.is/GZVg0#selection-507.0-511.110). It's a play on
"QAnon" (the right-wing equivalent) and was initially defined in Urban
Dictionary as follows:

> A loosely organized network of Democrat voters, politicians and media
> personalities who spread left-wing conspiracy theories such as the Russia
> Hoax, Jussie Smollett hoax, Ukraine hoax, Covington Kids hoax, and Brett
> Kavanaugh hoax. Blue Anon adherents fervently believe that right-wing
> extremists are going to storm Capitol Hill any day now and "remove" lawmakers
> from office, hence the need for the deployment of thousands of National Guard
> stationed at the U.S. Capitol.

About a day or two after this entry was made, Urban Dictionary removed it:

> I have never even heard of a word being banned from @UrbanDictionary before
> they banned Blue Anon
>

Additionally, Google scrubbed any mention of Blue Anon from search results. On
the other hand, virtually the entire first page of search results on DuckDuckGo
consisted of relevant material:

> Quite a difference between searching Google and DuckDuckGo for "Blue Anon"
> #blueanon
>
> it's almost like one of those sites is trying to hide it.

Some time over the following day or so, Urban Dictionary reallowed entries for
Blue Anon, and [they are visible](https://archive.is/nonHo) at the time of
writing.
