[Alternative video-hosting](/alt/video-hosting/) platform
[Odysee](/alt/odysee/) starting gradually rolling out the ability for users to
livestream:

> LIVESTREAMING IS NOW ON ODYSEE
>
> Look for the 'go live' button
>
> 500 users get it today.  Reply in comments with your channel name if you want
> access over the next day or so. 
>
> This will be a gradual (daily) roll out

The new feature was completely rolled out about three weeks later!

> Everyone can livestream on odysee now
>
> Just need 50 lbc staked
> If you don't have the lbc, a friend can boost you
> or just ask us
