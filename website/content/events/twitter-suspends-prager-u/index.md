Twitter temporarily suspended the PragerU account because it "violated the
Twitter Rules" by tweeting a link to the
[highly-censored](/events/white-coat-summit/) "White Coat Summit." Breitbart
[reported](http://archive.is/uiQAw#selection-553.0-553.232):
> Conservative non-profit group PragerU had its account restricted on Wednesday
> for allegedly violating the platform’s rules regarding posts about
> coronavirus after sharing a video of the “White Coat Summit” featuring
> medical doctors.

Dennis Prager had [previously warned](http://archive.is/zExya) conservatives
about the danger of not standing up to BigTech censorship.
