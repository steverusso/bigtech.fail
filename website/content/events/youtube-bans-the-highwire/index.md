YouTube deleted _The Highwire with Del Bigtree_, likely for espousing opinions
and information that contradict the establishment narrative on COVID-19. The
**3 year old channel** had **211k subscribers** and over **15.5 million
lifetime views**.

The [very last video](https://www.bitchute.com/video/K3mdOM93nkYB/) Del Bigtree
uploaded was of him talking about how he's going to make videos of kittens and
fluffy puppies while holding up signs that said he was being censored by
BigTech.

His channel was growing somewhat rapidly with a 23.5% increase in the total
subscriber count in the month leading up to being deleted.
