Wikipedia dropped Newsmax as a source altogether after an editor requested it
be increased in reliability. T.D. Adler, a former Wikipedia editor who writes
under a pseudonym, [reported for
Breitbart](https://archive.is/hWv9J#selection-549.0-557.1):

> Newsmax has seen growing audiences at its online and televised news platforms
> since the disputed 2020 Presidential election amid President Donald Trump’s
> criticism of other conservative media coverage. After a Wikipedia editor
> suggested having the outlet treated as reliable, other editors responded by
> having Newsmax banned from use as a source for factual claims instead, partly
> citing its coverage of election fraud allegations, making it the latest
> conservative outlet banned on Wikipedia in an ongoing purge.
