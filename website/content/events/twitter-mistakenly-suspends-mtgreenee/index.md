Twitter locked the account of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on the same day that
Democrats introduced a resolution to remove her from Congress:

> I was just told @Twitter suspended me for 12 hrs in “error,” on the same day
> Dems introduced a resolution to expel me from Congress.
>
> What a coincidence?
>
> Twitter’s little error wasn’t resolved until after 12 hrs.
>
> @jack which employee made the “error?”
>
> Reply to my email, Jack

Turns out this was just a mistake! An "error" from one of Twitter's automated
systems. Oopsies!
