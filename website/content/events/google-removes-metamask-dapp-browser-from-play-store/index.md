Google removed the MetaMask dApp browser from the Play Store citing a policy that prohibits cryptocurrency mining.
However, that doesn't make any sense since the MetaMask app doesn't mine cryptocurrency.

On December 26th, [@metamask_io](https://twitter.com/metamask_io) announced the suspension on Twitter starting with:
> In the last week, the MetaMask Android client was suspended by the Google Play App Store [@googleplaydev](https://twitter.com/GooglePlayDev).
> They cited their policy that bans mining on mobile, which we don't.
> Appeal rejected. [#ProtectWeb3](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ProtectWeb3).
> https://play.google.com/about/restricted-content/financial-services/#!?zippy_activeEl=cryptocurrencies%23cryptocurrencies

> The appeal rejection cited the same policy: No mining on [@Android](https://twitter.com/Android).
> We don't. It's unclear whether the reviewer doesn't understand the policy, or whether they are enforcing an unwritten policy.
> Either way, it's time to #ProtectWeb3.

About five hours later, [@GooglePlayDev](https://twitter.com/GooglePlayDev) responsded with the following:
> Hi , thanks for reaching out.
> We have escalated your issue to the relevant team for further investigation.
> We appreciate your patience while we are looking into this. #AskPlayDev

Dan Findlay (co-lead developer for MetaMask) said the following in [a statement to CoinTelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/google-suspends-metamask-from-its-play-app-store-citing-deceptive-services):
> If people accept this behavior from a mobile monopoly like Google, we may not deserve something better.

Thankfully, [Google reinstated the MetaMask app](https://web.archive.org/web/20200109172911/https://twitter.com/metamask_io/status/1212431777047830528) in the Play Store sometime around New Years.
