BigTech enforces an absurd level of censorship when it comes to any transgender-related material that is any bit critical.
YouTube gave us yet another example of this by removing InfiniteElgintensity's video where he criticizes trans cyclist Rachel McKinnon for saying that it's fair for transgender athletes to compete against women.

InfiniteElgintensity left a brief comment explaining the video's removal:
> YouTube removed my latest video for hate speech the day after manually reviewing it and approving it for all advertisers, then confirmed this decision on appeal. You can watch the new episode of "Exercises in Futility" on BitChute: [https://www.bitchute.com/video/alCqMghVL6E/](https://www.bitchute.com/video/alCqMghVL6E/)

Please consider [watching the video on BitChute](https://www.bitchute.com/video/alCqMghVL6E/). It's hilarious.
