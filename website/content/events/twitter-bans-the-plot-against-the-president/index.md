Twitter banned the official account for _The Plot Against the President_, a
documentary that covers how the Democrats and Washington establishment sought
to undermine the Trump presidency. The account, along with the accounts of
several crew members, was banned for "platform manipulation and spam." The
documentary's director said the following in a statement:

> Twitter suspended our account indefinitely for no reason. They have also
> suspended the accounts of several of our crew, many who don't even tweet.

This is in addition to Twitter [suppressing the
trailer](https://archive.is/wpYUA) a few months prior.

The account was shortly reinstated after significant backlash. This happened
about a month after [Amazon stalled the documentary's
release](/events/amazon-stalls-release-of-plot-against-the-president/) by over
a week (just a few weeks before the election).
