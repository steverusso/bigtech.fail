Julian Assange's Twitter account was suddenly removed early in the day on
Christmas, 2017, without comment or explanation from either Assange or Twitter.
It was shortly reinstated just as mysteriously as it had been removed.

While this was happening, the official Twitter account for the US Navy
strangely tweeted out "Julian Assange", quickly deleted the tweet a few minutes
later, and issued the following statement:
> This morning, an inadvertent keystroke by an authorized user of the U.S. Navy
> Office of Information's Digitial Media Engagement Team caused the trending
> term "Julian Assange" to be tweeted from the Navy's official Twitter account
> (@USNavy). (1/2)

Project Veritas [published a report a few weeks
later](/e/project-veritas-reveals-twitter-shadow-banning-in-undercover-video/)
primarily about Twitter's shadow banning practices and political bias. However,
within the investigative report, a Twitter engineer suggests to Project Veritas
journalists that Assange's account could have been removed due to pressure from
the US government.
