Shortly after the rioting in the US capitol on Jan 6, 2020,
[Twitter](/twitter/) and [Facebook](/facebook/) took several drastic actions
including suspending the President himself.

Twitter removed three of Trump's tweets (including ones that told the rioters
to stop and go home), suspended him for 12 hours, and then threatened a
permanent ban upon further violations.

> As a result of the unprecedented and ongoing violent situation in Washington,
> D.C., we have required the removal of three @realDonaldTrump Tweets that were
> posted earlier today for repeated and severe violations of our Civic
> Integrity policy.
>

Facebook and Instagram [removed](https://archive.is/IeAgL) one of President
Trump's videos and suspended his accounts indefinitely. Zuckerberg released a
statement that included the following:

> The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President
> Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the
> peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden.
> [...] Following the certification of the election results by Congress, the
> priority for the whole country must now be to ensure that the remaining 13
> days and the days after inauguration pass peacefully and in accordance with
> established democratic norms.

Facebook additionally [started removing all media from the US capitol
riots](https://reclaimthenet.org/facebook-bans-capitol-protest-photos-videos/).

The following day, [Twitch and Snapchat disabled Trump's
accounts](/e/twitch-snapchat-suspend-trump/). Two days later, [Twitter
permamently banned](/e/twitter-bans-trump/) Trump and suspended the @POTUS
account right after he used it.
