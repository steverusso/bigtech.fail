Shortly after WikiLeaks faced a wave of financial deplatforming towards the end of 2010, Apple removed an unofficial WikiLeaks app from the App Store.
The app, which was being sold for $1.99, displayed the Twitter feed of the official WikiLeaks account, as well as the content that WikiLeaks released.

As to why it was removed, a spokeswoman from Apple said the following in [a statement to CNET](https://archive.vn/WOEvw):
> We removed the WikiLeaks app from the App Store because it violated our developer guidelines.
> Apps must comply with all local laws and may not put an individual or targeted group in harm's way.
