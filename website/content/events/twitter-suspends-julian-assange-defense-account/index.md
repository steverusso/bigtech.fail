Twitter suspended [@Unity4J](https://twitter.com/Unity4J), one of the primary
accounts supporting Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, without warning or
explanation.

The account [was reinstated](https://archive.vn/79BLV) about a week later.

Twitter had [restricted the account of Julian Assange's mother, Christine
Assange](/events/twitter-restricts-julian-assanges-mother/), several months
prior.
