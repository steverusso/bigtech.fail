On August 29, 2020, Patriot Prayer member Aaron Danielson (also known as "Jay
Bishop") was murdered in Portland, OR by Michael Reinoehl, who described
himself as 100% Antifa. On September 3, Reinoehl was killed by U.S. Marshals
when they attempted to apprehend him.

The next day, Facebook not only deleted the Patriot Prayer page, but also
banned its founder, Joey Gibson, along with several of the page's admins.
Joey Gibson issued the following statement:
> Official statement: Antifa groups murdered my friend while he was walking
> home, and instead of the multibillion dollar company (FACEBOOK) banning
> Portland antifa pages they ban Patriot Prayer, Joey Gibson, and several other
> grandmas that are admins. People can sign up at PatriotPrayerUSA.com for
> future events.
