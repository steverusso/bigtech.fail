In April of 2017, YouTube made some slight adjustments to the Partner Program
that had major consequences. They created a minimum threshold of 10k views on a
channel before it could even _apply_ for monetization. YouTube could then
ensure the channel was following the ever-changing community guidelines and
advertiser policies before accepting it into the program. In YouTube's [own
words](http://archive.is/q7TB2#selection-121.333-121.440):
> Together these new thresholds will help ensure revenue only flows to creators
> who are playing by the rules.

These changes came after a few months of controversy. In February of 2017,
PewDiePie (a very popular content creator) published a video that YouTube
decreed as "hate speech." Shortly afterwards, several major corporations halted
their advertising spending on YouTube until the platform cracked down on what
they viewed as constroversial content. PewDiePie designated the ensuing revenue
instability as _the adpocalypse_.

These policy changes caused significant revenue cuts for channels of all
categories, so much so that YouTube actually issued a statement about a month
later that [opens with](http://archive.is/Q2APC#selection-357.0-357.327) how
advertisers are noticing the changes as a good thing:
> We know the last month has been really tough for creators after some brands
> paused their spend on YouTube and we began implementing new advertiser
> controls. We wanted to update you that we're making progress. Advertisers are
> noticing the improvements we've made and, as a result, our conversations with
> them are more positive.
