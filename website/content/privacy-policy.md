We don't collect anything.

### Additionally...

* This site <u>has NO JavaScript</u> (everything will function the exact same
  way whether you have JavaScript enabled or not).
* This site does NOT embed content from any other site.
* This project is [open source](https://github.com/steverusso/bigtech.fail),
  allowing you to verify everything said here for yourself.

### Final Thoughts

* Government regulation can never lead to true privacy protection online. It
	will only increase the size and scope of government, as well as legitimize
	government attempts to get a strangle hold on the Internet.
* If you truly care about privacy, consider taking the following actions to
  learn more and protect yourself:
  * Checkout this ["awesome-privacy" repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pluja/awesome-privacy) which lists privacy-respecting alternatives to many common technologies and services.
  * Learn about network anonymization tools such as [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) and [i2p](https://geti2p.net/en/).
