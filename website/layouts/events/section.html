				The main purpose of an Event in this context is to provide evidence
				that something happened on a certain date. In other words, Events
				should be thought of more as living records and <i>not</i> as news
				reports. By extension, this page is simply a chronological collection
				of <strong>{{ len .Pages }}</strong> records, <i>not</i> a news feed.
